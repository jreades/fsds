I get [more than 285,000 questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) tagged with pandas on StackOverflow. \n\nThis week we are also going to start looking at the **[InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/)** data which forms the core of the work that we do over the rest of the term. The focus of *this* notebook is simple numeric data: no mapping or text data... yet... and direct manipulation of data types, derivation of summary statistics, and simple plotting.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to draw on the past few practical sessions to develop a more intuitive understanding of how to interact with pandas since it supports both a 'dictionary-of-lists' style of interaction *and* a methods-based style of interaction with the 'Data Frame'.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n### Important\n\nConceptually, this practical links together _all_ of the preceding ones; you will find data structures, classes and methods, reading CSV files from a remote location, `numpy`, and more than you ever wanted to know about data types in Python. Making these connections will make the remainder of term much, much easier, so it might be worth **revising this practical** over Reading Week so make sure it all makes sense!\n\n:::\n\n# The Importance of EDA\n\nAfter a few weeks getting to grips with Python, we're now going to start working with some real data. One of the first things that we do when working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There are a _huge_ number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n\n1. Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size was, etc.)\n2. Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column specs, etc.)\n3. Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels\n4. Producing descriptive statistics\n5. Visualising the data using plots\n\nYou should use _all_ of these together to really understand where the data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other problems. If you're wondering which comes first, the concept of _start with a chart_ is always good... though we've obviously not _quite_ gotten there yet! This week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself, so although we will do some plotting of charts, we'll focus on 3-4 with a tiny bit of 5. There will be much more on plotting charts next week, and you should be looking into 1 and 2 yourself based on what's been written both on the [Inside Airbnb web site](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) and in the [suggested readings](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/ref/Bibliography.md).\n\nSo although they don't need to be done now, you probably want to add both those links to your reading list!\n\n# Preamble\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n#### &#128279; Connections\n\nThis is why we spent time talking about [Packages](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week3.html#lectures), [Methods](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week4.html#lectures) [Classes](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week4.html#lectures) in the lectures... because now we're going to be making _intensive_ use of them.\n\n:::\n\nIt's always sensible to import packages these at the top of the notebook:\n\n1. Because it lets everyone know what they need to have installed to run your code.\n2. It's easy to run this and then skip further down the notebook if you have already done *some* of the work and saved an intermediate output.\n\n::: {#4218947e .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\nBeyond what we provide below there are [numerous](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=introduction+to+pandas+python) useful introductions; [one of our favourites](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) is from Greg Reda, and there are some [good videos](https://youtu.be/TSsSWuhBpmY) on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ5Y5hxm-0W7rOOYBHf6KC6QNnWOi09kh). And of course, there’s [TONS of stuff](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) on StackOverflow. If you want an actual physical book, you might try [McKinney (2017)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do).\n\nHowever, one thing you will really want to bookmark is [the official documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) since you will undoubtedly need to refer to it fairly regularly. _Note_: this link is to the most recent release. Over time there will be updates published and you _may_ find that you no longer have the most up-to-date version. If you find that you are now using an older version of pandas and the methods have changed then you'll need to track down the _specific_ version of the documentation that you need from the [home page](http://pandas.pydata.org).\n\nYou can always check what version you have installed like this:\n\n::: {#81f4529d .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(pd.__version__)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n2.2.2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe `<package_name>.__version__` approach isn't guaranteed to work with _every_ package, but it will work with most of them. Remember that variables and methods starting and ending with '`__`' are **private** and any interaction with them should be approached very, very carefully.\n\n:::\n\n# Reading and Writing Data\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n#### &#128279; Connections\n\nYou will _really_ need to get to grips with Pandas through the lectures on [Data](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week5.html#lectures) and [Pandas](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week5.html#lectures).\n\n:::\n\nPandas can do a *lot*, and you might be feeling a little intimidated by this, but here's the thing: we were already writing something like pandas from scratch! That's because pandas takes a **column-view of data** in the same way that our **Dictionary-of-Lists** did, it's just that it's got a lot more features than our 'simple' tool did. That's why the documentation is so much more forbidding and why pandas is so much more powerful.\n\nBut at its heart, a pandas `Data Frame` (`df` for short) is a collection of `Data Series` objects (i.e. columns) with an index. Each Series is like one of our column-lists from the last notebook. And the `df` is like the dictionary that held the data together. So you've seen this before and you already _know_ what's going on... or at least you now have an _analogy_ that you can use to make sense of pandas:\n\n```python\nmyDataFrame = {\n    '<column_name_1>': <Series_1>,\n    '<column_name_2>': <Series_2>,\n    '<column_name_3>': <Series_3>\n}\n``` \n\nAnd pandas gives us two ways to access that data:\n\n1. Using a method syntax: `myDataFrame.column_name_1`\n2. Using a dictionary syntax: `myDataFrame['column_name_1']`\n\nDepending on which syntax you prefer, you can use these interchangeably. The only times you *have* to choose one over the other are: \n\n- Assignment (e.g. `myDataFrame['column_name_1'] = ...`); \n- Columns with spaces in their names (e.g. `myDataFrame['Column Name 1')`).\n\n## Reading Remote Data\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low (this time around).\n\n:::\n\nYou will need to do several things here to read the remote, compressed CSV file specified by `url` into a data frame called `df`. Setting `low_memory=False` ensures that pandas will try to load the entire data set _before_ guessing the data format! Obviously, with very large files this is probably a bad idea and it's possible to force a particular column type while readng in the data as well. For larger data sets there are platforms like [Dask](https://dask.org/) (see, eg, [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-and-how-to-use-dask-with-big-data-746e34dac7c3)), and beyond that are [other options](https://towardsdatascience.com/scaling-pandas-comparing-dask-ray-modin-vaex-and-rapids-c74c85a4e59c).\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\n# Set download URL\nymd  = '{{< var data.ymd >}}'\nhost = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'\nurl  = f'{host}/~jreades/data/{ymd}-listings.csv.gz'\n\n# your code here\ndf = pd.read_csv(??, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\nThis is a bit of a fuller answer than the question, but hopefully you'll see why we take this approach as a 'better' one that the skeleton set out in the Question. Note that you can also find reviews and calendar at the same location as the listings file (i.e. `{{< var data.ymd >}}-calendar.csv.gz`)\n\n::: {#2a360c24 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Notice that we import a specific error here\n# but other types of errors (e.g. NameError)\n# are always available because they're so basic.\nfrom urllib.error import URLError\n\n# Set download URL\nymd  = '2023-09-06'\nhost = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'\nurl  = f'{host}/~jreades/data/{ymd}-listings.csv.gz'\n\nif not os.path.exists('tmp.csv.gz'):\n    print(\"Didn't find tmp.csv.gz locally\")\n    try:\n        df = pd.read_csv(url, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)\n        df.to_csv('tmp.csv.gz', compression='gzip', index=False)\n    except URLError as e:\n        print(f\"Unable to access: {url}\")\n        print(e)\nelse:\n    print(\"Found tmp.csv.gz locally\")\n    df = pd.read_csv('tmp.csv.gz', compression='gzip', low_memory=False)\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\nexcept NameError as e:\n    print(\"Unable to load the data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFound tmp.csv.gz locally\nData frame is 87,953 x 75\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nYou should get a data frame containing 75 columns and 87\\,953 rows of data.\n\n## Inspecting the Data Frame\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low.\n\n:::\n\nLet's get a general sense of the data by printing out information _about_ the data frame. There are several ways to do this (and we'll see another futher on):\n\n- `df.describe(percentiles=None, include=None, exclude=None, datetime_is_numeric=False)` -- descriptive stats for all **numeric** columns\n- `df.info(verbose=None, buf=None, max_cols=None, memory_usage=None, show_counts=None)` -- summarises all columns, but without distribution information\n- `df.memory_usage(index=True, deep=True)` -- memory usage details about each column (can be quite slow as it's doing a *lot* of digging)\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\nWhat is another term for the 0.5 percentile?\n\n#### Answer\n\nThe median!\n\n::::\n\n### Describing\n\n\n\nDescribing a data frame provides general information about *numeric* columns, such as the median, IQR, or number of discrete values. \n\nSo to show the 5th and 95th percentiles you need to pass an argument to `describe` to override the default report from pandas:\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\ndf.describe(percentiles=[??])\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#a7f92cd1 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.describe(percentiles=[.05,0.95]) # 0.5 is always shown\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=84}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n

(text) columns and that some columns contain many nulls. You will also get an *estimate* of memory usage that may differ substantially from the more complete picture provided below, which suggests a 'true' value of 396MB.\n\n### Memory Usage\n\nIf you really need to get into the 'weeds' and profile your data frame because you are crashing Python and seeing messages about 'core dumped', or seeing appallingly poor performance, then `memory_usage` is the way to go:\n\n```python\ndf.memory_usage(index=True, deep=True)\n```\n\n::: {.longform}\n\n::: {#d6467faf .cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=86}\n```\nIndex                                               132\nid                                               703624\nlisting_url                                     7940958\nscrape_id                                       5540904\nlast_scraped                                    5189137\n                                                 ...   \ncalculated_host_listings_count                   703624\ncalculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes      703624\ncalculated_host_listings_count_private_rooms     703624\ncalculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms      703624\nreviews_per_month                                703624\nLength: 76, dtype: int64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nYou should see that the data frame uses 415\\,086\\,430 bytes of memory, but the *really* important thing to note here is the difference between `string` and other types of data: keeping data as raw strings (instead of converting to categories, for instance) uses up a *lot* more memory and this can have a huge impact on the performance of your code.\n\n### Printing the Columns\n\nFinally, I find it *very* useful to be able to quickly print out a list of the **columns** without all of the details shown above. You just need to _print_ the _columns_ as a _list_:\n\n::: {#a2d76c1f .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(df.columns.to_list())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['id', 'listing_url', 'scrape_id', 'last_scraped', 'source', 'name', 'description', 'neighborhood_overview', 'picture_url', 'host_id', 'host_url', 'host_name', 'host_since', 'host_location', 'host_about', 'host_response_time', 'host_response_rate', 'host_acceptance_rate', 'host_is_superhost', 'host_thumbnail_url', 'host_picture_url', 'host_neighbourhood', 'host_listings_count', 'host_total_listings_count', 'host_verifications', 'host_has_profile_pic', 'host_identity_verified', 'neighbourhood', 'neighbourhood_cleansed', 'neighbourhood_group_cleansed', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'property_type', 'room_type', 'accommodates', 'bathrooms', 'bathrooms_text', 'bedrooms', 'beds', 'amenities', 'price', 'minimum_nights', 'maximum_nights', 'minimum_minimum_nights', 'maximum_minimum_nights', 'minimum_maximum_nights', 'maximum_maximum_nights', 'minimum_nights_avg_ntm', 'maximum_nights_avg_ntm', 'calendar_updated', 'has_availability', 'availability_30', 'availability_60', 'availability_90', 'availability_365', 'calendar_last_scraped', 'number_of_reviews', 'number_of_reviews_ltm', 'number_of_reviews_l30d', 'first_review', 'last_review', 'review_scores_rating', 'review_scores_accuracy', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_checkin', 'review_scores_communication', 'review_scores_location', 'review_scores_value', 'license', 'instant_bookable', 'calculated_host_listings_count', 'calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes', 'calculated_host_listings_count_private_rooms', 'calculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms', 'reviews_per_month']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should get a list showing every single column. If you get `Index(['id', 'listing_url',...], dtype='object')` then you have printed the column _index_ object and you to need to tell the object to convert its output **to a list** (*hint*: Google).\n\n## Saving the File Locally\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nNow save the file somewhere local so that you don't have to keep downloading 40MB of compressed data every time you want to start the practical. We'll be using this data for the rest of term, so you might as well save yourself some time and bandwidth! We'll talk more about data processing pipelines over the course of the term, but I'd suggest putting this data set into a `data/raw` folder because then you can have directories like `data/clean` and `data/analytical` as you move through the process of cleaning and prepping your data for analysis.\n\n::: {#32f4cedb .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npath = os.path.join('data','raw') # A default location to save raw data\nfn   = url.split('/')[-1]         # What does this do?\nprint(f\"Writing to: {fn}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWriting to: 2023-09-06-listings.csv.gz\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#25c929e0 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nif not os.path.exists(path):      # And what does *this* do?\n    print(f\"Creating {path} under {os.getcwd()}\")\n    os.makedirs(path)\n\nif not os.path.exists(os.path.join(path,fn)):  \n    df.to_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), index=False)\n    print(\"Done.\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Managing Your Data\n\nWhen starting out it's common to think in terms of there being one input (the raw data) and one output (the results) to an analysis. In practice, you will have many intermediate outputs used as 'milestones' in the overall analysis: \n\n- You might have a 'canonical' data file that has dealt with formatting issues and converted the columns to appropriate data types.\n- You might have a 'clean' data file that has dealt with observations that seem to be incomplete or otherwise improperly formatted.\n- You might generate subsets by region or area.\n- You might produce an 'analytical' or 'final' data set appropriate to a specific analysis.\n\n**Most importantly**, if you are going to run the same analysis multiple times using data from different time periods (e.g. Land Registry's Price Paid Data is updated every month) then you will *multiple* versions of each of each of the above.\n\nBut, *in addition*, you might also be working with such a large data set that processing the *entire* thing every time you want to do some development work is impractical: do you want to load 1 billion rows only to find out that you needed 1,000 of them or that one of your columns is incorrectly formatted?\n\nSo although you _could_ do the next few steps as part of loading the _raw_ data, I always prefer to keep the original data set handy since I almost always discover that there are fields I didn't realise I needed when I started my work. \n\nSo my approach to coding is usually:\n\n1. Download the raw file and save it locally in a `data/raw` directory.\n2. Load the first `nrows` of data so that I can quickly:\n   - Check that the specification matches the data and select columns/rows accordingly.\n   - Identify obviously invalid rows/columns and investigate further.\n   - Check the code to fix data types and (where relevant) values works.\n   - Write this new, smaller file ($m` << m$ and $n` << n$) out to a `data/clean` or `data/canonical` directory (depending on whether formatting the columns is so complex or takes so long on a large data set that it needs to be separated out from actual cleaning).\n   - Test out some initial ideas for further analysis.\n3. Re-run the code (remove the `nrows` limit) using the full data set.\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Moderate\n\nAlthough the code here is simple, the logic is not.\n\n::: \n\n## File Names\n\nYou should always be looking for ways to _avoid_ hard-coding values that might change over time, especially those linked to the date of the data file.\n\nIn this case you might try to work out how to make it easy to update the code to download the latest file. For instance, if the file looks like `2022-09-10-listings.csv.gz` then I might well specify the `url` as `{date}-listings.csv.gz` or `{year}-{month}-{day}-listings.csv.gz` and set up the variables that I need beforehand or in a separate file.\n\nUsing parameters makes it easier to write robust code that doesn't have unwanted side-effects. Here's a common one: you write code to download and process a file named `20221111-data.csv.gz`. After doing all the steps in Tasks 2 and 3 below you save it to `clean-data.csv.gz`. \n\n::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\nWhat happens when your boss asks you to process `20221211-data.csv.gz`?\n\n#### Answer\n\nYou are going to lose every single output from the 2022-11-11 data that depends on `clean-data.csv.gz` because they are *all* going to now be generated from the 2022-12-11 data set instead. Worse, you will almost certainly have *no* way of knowing which output came from which data set (because you probably stopped tracking dates very early in your application).\n\n:::\n\n## File Loading\n\nNow let's write something that will allow us to more quickly write our code and validate the results in exploratory phase. For simplicity I've called this 'testing', but you could also think of it as 'dev' mode. What we want is to be able to easily swap between testing and operational contexts using a 'switch' (typically, a Boolean value) and limit the data load in testing mode.\n\nTo achieve this you could set pandas to:\n\n- Load only the first 10,000 rows using `nrows` *if* we are testing\n- Use the columns specified in `cols`\n- Allow pandas to load the entire data set before deciding on the column type by setting `low_memory` appropriately.\n\n### Row Subsetting\n\nLet's tackle the *rows* problem first:\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\ntesting = True\n\nif testing:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=??, ??)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=??)\n\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#45999ceb .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntesting = True\n\nif testing:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, nrows=10000)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False)\n\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nData frame is 10,000 x 75\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nSo notice how this code deliberately works the same for either testing _or_ operational execution -- we just flip between the option by changing the `testing` variable from `True` to `False`! \n\nTo make this more robust and useful we could use this `testing` variable *throughout* our code if we wanted to change other behaviours based on development/deployment context. The state of the switch could then be set globally using an external configuration file (usually just called a 'conf file'). The easiest way to do this is to have a `conf.py` which contains your global parameters and then every script or notebook file reads in the configuration and sets these variables.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\ntesting = False\n```\n\nAnd:\n\n```python\nfrom conf import *\n```\n\n### Column Subsetting\n\nNow let's tackle the column problem... In order to avoid having to load lots of data that we aren't sure we need yet, we can restrict the columns that we load. We got `cols` below by copying the output of (`df.columns.to_list()` and then removing the fields that we thought we _weren't_ interested in.\n\n::: {#e8b9af86 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncols = ['id', 'listing_url', 'last_scraped', 'name', 'description', 'host_id', \n        'host_name', 'host_since', 'host_location', 'host_about', 'host_is_superhost', \n        'host_listings_count', 'host_total_listings_count', 'host_verifications', \n        'latitude', 'longitude', 'property_type', 'room_type', 'accommodates', \n        'bathrooms', 'bathrooms_text', 'bedrooms', 'beds', 'amenities', 'price', \n        'minimum_nights', 'maximum_nights', 'availability_365', 'number_of_reviews', \n        'first_review', 'last_review', 'review_scores_rating', 'license', \n        'reviews_per_month']\nprint(f\"Cols contains {len(cols)} columns.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCols contains 34 columns.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo let's extend our previous answer\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\ntesting = True\n\nif testing:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, nrows=10000, ??)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, ??)\n\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#d8a585b1 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntesting = True\n\nif testing:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, nrows=10000, usecols=cols)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, usecols=cols)\n\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nData frame is 10,000 x 34\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n## Releasing Memory\n\nA particular risk when working with Jupyter notebooks is that you either: a) have run code in an order *other* than the order shown in the notebook; or b) have made edits to code but *not* re-run the changed code. So you're still working from code that is no longer visible! \n\nWhen that happens you can get *very* confusing issues because what you *see* doesn't square with what the computer has *executed*. To resolve this without having to re-run the entire notebook (though that can *also* be a good choice!) you might want to 'delete' the current object and re-load or re-run the relevant data or code. \n\n::: {#23f459fa .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndel(df)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo we use `del(df)` to ensure that we aren't accidentally using the 'old' data frame. But another good reason to delete data you're no longer using is to free up memory.\n\n# Exploring Your Data\n\nLet's start over from the saved data:\n\n::: {#0114713c .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,fn), \n                low_memory=False, usecols=cols)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Selecting Rows \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n#### &#128279; Connections\n\nYou will want to refer to the [Randomness](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week5.html#lectures) lecture to understand how we can select the _same_ random sample each time and to the session on [Logic](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week5.html#lectures) lecture to cover `NaN`s and `NA`s.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nI often like to start my EDA by simply printing out randomly-selected rows to get a feel for what's in the data. Does what I see square with what I read in the documentation? What does the `name` look like? What do I see in `last_scraped` and is it a sensible? What's the `id` field for?\n\n::: {#18243689 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.sample(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=95}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>listing_url</th>\n      <th>last_scraped</th>\n      <th>name</th>\n      <th>description</th>\n      <th>host_id</th>\n      <th>host_name</th>\n      <th>host_since</th>\n      <th>host_location</th>\n      <th>host_about</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>price</th>\n      <th>minimum_nights</th>\n      <th>maximum_nights</th>\n      <th>availability_365</th>\n      <th>number_of_reviews</th>\n      <th>first_review</th>\n      <th>last_review</th>\n      <th>review_scores_rating</th>\n      <th>license</th>\n      <th>reviews_per_month</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>25490</th>\n      <td>25802906.0</td>\n      <td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25802906</td>\n      <td>2023-09-06</td>\n      <td>Home in Greater London · ★5.0 · 3 bedrooms · 3...</td>\n      <td>Stay calm and relaxed in a comfortable modern ...</td>\n      <td>46564911.0</td>\n      <td>Roger</td>\n      <td>2015-10-14</td>\n      <td>London, United Kingdom</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>$99.00</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>10.0</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>2018-06-14</td>\n      <td>2018-07-29</td>\n      <td>5.00</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>0.06</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>37886</th>\n      <td>40361254.0</td>\n      <td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40361254</td>\n      <td>2023-09-06</td>\n      <td>Rental unit in Greater London · ★4.48 · 1 bedr...</td>\n      <td>Just a stone's throw from King's Cross St Panc...</td>\n      <td>259278549.0</td>\n      <td>Joe A Joseph</td>\n      <td>2019-05-01</td>\n      <td>London, United Kingdom</td>\n      <td>I love traveling.

This is particularly likely if you are using Anaconda Python directly (i.e. not Docker).

I would take values greater than 3–5 as being ones that are most likely be problematic.

The *full* syntax is `df[<row_selection>,<col_selection>]`. Only when we *don't* specify both does it then default to `df[<col_selection>]`. \n\nTo make the most of pandas you will need to get to grips with the logic than underpins this syntax. This is embedded in the idea of there being row and column indexes. These are *like* the columns `A`..`ZZ` and the rows 1..n in Excel. As you'll have seen in [the video](), these aren't considered *data*, they are ways to *access the data*. Unlike Excel, while every data frame must *have* an index, in pandas you can 'promote' or 'demote' any column to be used *as* an index. \n\nThe default row index is just the row number — this will be created for you if you don't specify something else when you create the data frame. The default column index is created from a file's column names (works for many types of data) but you can change these at any time.\n\n## Label and Numeric Indexing\n\nPerhaps this will (eventually) help to make it more clear:\n\n::: {#141f55ca .cell execution_count=30}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.loc[\n    [4552, 4554, 4556, 4557],\n    ['latitude','longitude','property_type','room_type','price']\n]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=109}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>latitude</th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>property_type</th>\n      <th>room_type</th>\n      <th>price</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4552</th>\n      <td>51.531070</td>\n      <td>-0.186060</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>$95.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4554</th>\n      <td>51.476640</td>\n      <td>-0.215200</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>$250.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4556</th>\n      <td>51.400162</td>\n      <td>-0.076788</td>\n      <td>Private room in home</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>$56.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4557</th>\n      <td>51.408920</td>\n      <td>-0.180910</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>$150.00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd compare *that* with:\n\n::: {#8e9d32cf .cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.iloc[\n    4552:4557,\n    14:19\n]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=110}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>property_type</th>\n      <th>room_type</th>\n      <th>accommodates</th>\n      <th>bathrooms_text</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4655</th>\n      <td>-0.15610</td>\n      <td>Private room in home</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>1 shared bath</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4656</th>\n      <td>-0.11470</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>1 bath</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4657</th>\n      <td>-0.06745</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>1 shared bath</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4658</th>\n      <td>-0.24050</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>1 bath</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4659</th>\n      <td>-0.18325</td>\n      <td>Private room in home</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>1 bath</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis code *seems* similar, but what are `iloc` and `loc`? The way I remember it is that `iloc` means *integer* location (as you would with *list indexing*), while `loc` means *label* location (as you would with *dictionary keys* or labels). I guess that should therefore be `lloc`, but you get the idea).\n\n## Numeric Indexes\n\nIn this case, the **index** (the numbers down the left-hand side in bold) is numeric, so we can treat it as a *label* (which allows us to use `df.loc`) *or* a list-type index (which allows us to use `df.iloc`). So with `loc` we refer to the columns by *label*, whereas with `iloc` we refer to them by *location*; as well, `loc` allows us to access rows and columns non-sequentially/randomly by label, while `iloc` allows us to access them as a numeric range.\n\n## Non-numeric Indexes\n\nNotice how this works differently if we specify a **non-numeric index**:\n\n::: {#3039c036 .cell execution_count=32}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.set_index('listing_url')[\n    ['latitude','longitude','property_type','room_type','price']\n].sample(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=111}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>latitude</th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>property_type</th>\n      <th>room_type</th>\n      <th>price</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>listing_url</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/762957927200510209</th>\n      <td>51.54788</td>\n      <td>-0.12084</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>$68.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22387033</th>\n      <td>51.53077</td>\n      <td>-0.13211</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>$21.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/771061462307304203</th>\n      <td>51.46530</td>\n      <td>-0.05178</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>$185.00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice change in indexing because 'listing_url' is no longer a column, it's the index now!\n\n::: {#28565e69 .cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.set_index('listing_url').iloc[0:3,13:18] \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=112}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>property_type</th>\n      <th>room_type</th>\n      <th>accommodates</th>\n      <th>bathrooms_text</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>listing_url</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/92644</th>\n      <td>-0.18739</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>1.5 shared baths</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/93015</th>\n      <td>-0.21707</td>\n      <td>Entire rental unit</td>\n      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n      <td>1 bath</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13913</th>\n      <td>-0.11270</td>\n      <td>Private room in rental unit</td>\n      <td>Private room</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>1 shared bath</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\nIt's vital that you understand how this code _works_. By which I mean _why_ it does something at all, not exactly how to use `loc` and `iloc` (though that is also useful).\n\n`df.set_index(...)` changes the index from the default row number to another field in the data frame. This operation _returns_ a new data frame with `listing_url` as its index. Because set index returned a data frame, we can simply add _another_ method call (`iloc` or `loc`) on to the end of that line and _it_ returns a new data frame in turn! \n    \nThe fact that each operation returns a new data frame (or data series) is why you can even do this:\n\n::: {#6d6dc630 .cell execution_count=34}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n    df.set_index('listing_url').iloc[0:3].latitude.mean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=113}\n```\n51.50351666666666\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n# Fixing Data Types\n\nIf you want to challenge yourself, then I'd suggest trying to work out how to adapt what we saw in previous weeks using the data type dictionary to map column names to column types; however, a more straightforward way to do this is to create different for loops for each:\n\n##  Profiling (Optional)\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low.\n\n:::\n\nThe Pandas Profiling tool (rebranded a year or so back as [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling)) offers an alternative way of understanding what's going on in your data. The output [looks rather nice](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/) and you might be tempted to ask why we didn't use this straight away on the full data set -- well, if you really want to know, see what happens when you profile all 70,000-odd rows and 70-odd columns in the raw data frame... in effect: while it's 'nice to have', the likelihood of crashing your computer increases significantly and it's a bit of a tangent, so that's why it's no longer included in the Docker image.\n\nIf you *do* want to explore this then you'll need to install the library, and **this is a good chance to look at a quite sophisiticated way to install software on another machine**:\n\n```python\nfrom ydata_profiling import ProfileReport\n```\n\n### Specify the Profiling Columns\n\nLooking back over earlier code see if you can work out how to profile `latitude`, `longitude`,and `review_scores_rating` together.\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\nprofile = ProfileReport(??, title=\"Pandas Profiling Report\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n```python\nprofile = ProfileReport(df[['latitude','longitude','review_scores_rating']], title=\"Pandas Profiling Report\")\n```\n\n::::\n\n### Profiling Targets\n\nYou can write the profile either directly into the Jupyter notebook (this file) or into a separate HTML (i.e. Web) page.\n\n```python\nprofile.to_notebook_iframe()\n# You can also write this profile to a web page:\n# profile.to_file(\"your_report.html\")\n```\n\n## Managing Memory\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low.\n\n:::\n\nAs to _why_ you'd want to fix your data types, there are two reasons: 1) to ensure that you can make the *most* of your data; 2) to ensure that it takes up as little space as possible in memory. Some simple examples:\n\n- A column containing only `'True'` (4 bytes) and `'False'` (5 bytes) will take up much more space than a column containing only `True` and `False` (1 bit each).\n- A column containing only `'Red'`, `'Green'`, and `'Blue'` (3, 5, and 4 bytes each respectively) will take up much more space that a column where we use the numbers `1, 2, 3` to represent these values and have a map that tells us `1==Red`, `2==Blue`, and `3==Green`.\n\nLet's test this idea out:\n\n::: {#459ba281 .cell execution_count=35}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nrtm = df.room_type.memory_usage(deep=True) # Room Type Memory\nctm = df.room_type.astype('category').memory_usage(deep=True) # Categorical Type Memory\n\nprint(f\"The raw memory usage of `room_type` is {rtm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"The categorical memory usage of `room_type` is {ctm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"That's {(ctm/rtm)*100:.0f}% of the original!\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe raw memory usage of `room_type` is 7,958 Kb.\nThe categorical memory usage of `room_type` is 2,813 Kb.\nThat's 35% of the original!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#2e91ad37 .cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nshm = df.host_is_superhost.memory_usage(deep=True) # Super Host Memory\nbhm = df.host_is_superhost.replace({'f':False, 't':True}).astype('bool').memory_usage(deep=True) # Boolean Host Memory\n\nprint(f\"The raw memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is {shm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"The boolean memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is {bhm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"That's {(bhm/shm)*100:.0f}% of the original!\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe raw memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is 6,870 Kb.\nThe boolean memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is 2,812 Kb.\nThat's 41% of the original!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Boolean Values\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Moderate.\n\n:::\n\nLet's start with columns that are likely to be boolean:\n\n::: {#5fd1cbc5 .cell execution_count=37}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbools = ['host_is_superhost']\ndf.sample(5, random_state=43)[bools]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=116}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>host_is_superhost</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>55197</th>\n      <td>f</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>24505</th>\n      <td>f</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>44546</th>\n      <td>f</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>16312</th>\n      <td>t</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>66564</th>\n      <td>f</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we have to `map` 't' to True and 'f' to False _before_ converting the column to a boolean type.

We've left plotting until a little later in this practical so that we could see some other basic attributes of how pandas stores data. We'll look at plotting and exploratory data analyses in much more detail next week, including using packages other than pandas. \n\nFor now, let's look at the basic plotting functionality pandas provides - in conjunctions with the online documentation for both [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html) and [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html). There are also examples of all [the different types of plots pandas can produce](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html).\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### MacOS plotting *without* Docker\n\nMacOS users who are *not* using Docker will need to do certain things in a specific order at the start of any notebook in order to show maps or graphs. Please make a copy of the following code for any notebook that you create and make it the *first* code that you run in the notebook...\n\n```python\n# Needed on a Mac\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.use('TkAgg')\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n:::\n\n### Histograms\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nFirst, let's see some of the ways we could visualise the distribution of the `Series` in the dataset:\n\n::: {#de61231e .cell execution_count=71}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.price.plot.hist() # histogram\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-72-output-1.png){width=610 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the code worked properly you should have just created a standard [histogram](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.hist.html) plot (if you can't see one, ask for help). However, a basic problem here may be the range of the data: if your maximum price is much more than £5,000 then you'll find the majority of your data plotted in one bar, which isn't very helpful.\n\nYou can filter the data *and* pass in some simple options to improve the plotting:\n\n::: {#a31b55fb .cell execution_count=72}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Notice the ';' here to suppress `<AxesSubplot...>`\n# That information doesn't *always* appear, but whenever\n# you have unwanted textual output above your plot just\n# add a ';' on the end of the line of code!\ndf[df.price < 1000].price.plot.hist(bins=50); \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-73-output-1.png){width=610 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### KDE Plots\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nSimilarly, we can produce a [Kernel Density Estimate plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.kde.html). This time, instead of dropping data just before calling `plot` we're going to modify the *limits* of the x-axis using `xlim`:\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\nLook for information about using `xlim`:\n\n```python\ndf.price.plot.kde(xlim=(??)); #kernel density estimate plot\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#5cb3da1e .cell execution_count=73}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.price.plot.kde(xlim=(0,1000)); #kernel density estimate plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-74-output-1.png){width=631 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nKind of handy, no? These aren't the _best_ looking plots, but they are all being generated on-the-fly for you by pandas with no more than a cheery `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>`! Since those plots are all just method calls, many of them take optional parameters to change the colour, the notation (scientific or not), and other options. For example, many of the documentation pages linked to above are rather brief, but include a link to [the general options that can be applied to all `Series.plot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.html) calls.\n\nThis is why we like pandas: it allows us to be _constructively lazy_. We don't need to know _how_ a draw a KDE plot (though it always helps if you don't see what you expected), we just need to know that pandas provides a method that will do it for you. And _that_ is why it's always worth having a [look at the documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html). \n\n### A Slight Case of Over-Plotting\n\nGenerally, Jupyter is clever enough to overlay plots one on top of the other if you call them all in the same cell. We'll see ways to gain more control later, but this is still a good start! Note that here we also need to get rid of the `-inf` values from rows that had a price of £0.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n#### Bug Alert {{< fa bug-slash >}}\n\nThe more we use pandas to sort and filter data the more you will start to see a `SettingWithCopyWarning`. This happens because of an interaction between how Pandas works and how Python works: when you are working with a very large data set you don't want to make a 'deep copy' of the data structure every time you make a change to the data. Instead, you get a 'view' into the data using a reference, which is a just a lightweight shortcut. So what happens when you try to modify that lightweight copy? Well, if you want to drop rows or columns then you either want to make a `copy()` at that point, or you will have to accept the warning *and* the computational risks that go with it.\n\n:::\n\n::: {#5528cde2 .cell execution_count=74}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Calling copy() ensures the index is updated\n# and note that all subsequent plots will have\n# these £0 rows removed!\ndf = df[df.price > 0].copy() \ndf.z.plot.kde(xlim=[-2, 10])\ndf.iqs.plot.kde(xlim=[-2, 10])\ndf.lnprice.plot.kde();\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-75-output-1.png){width=606 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplots\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nA standard [boxplot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.box.html):\n\n::: {#d8a2f43c .cell execution_count=75}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.lnprice.plot.box(figsize=(4, 8));\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-76-output-1.png){width=343 height=633}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Scatterplots\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Low\n\n:::\n\nWe can also plot two variables in a [scatter plot](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter.html#pandas.DataFrame.plot.scatter) by applying a plot method to the `DataFrame` (not an individual `Series`):\n\n::: {#f8e71d56 .cell execution_count=76}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.plot.scatter(x='longitude', y='latitude', c='price', s=2, cmap='viridis', figsize=(15,10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Practical-05-Numeric_Data_files/figure-html/cell-77-output-1.png){width=1141 height=803}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote how the code above has the form `DataFrame.plot.<plot type>`, not `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>` as in the prior plots.
