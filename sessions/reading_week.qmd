## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's learning objectives are:

1. Get caught up on any missed reading(s).
2. Start to work on the first few questions of the [group assessment](../assessments/group.qmd).
3. Start to test your ability to work with the Inside Airbnb data ([Week 5 Practical](week5.qmd#practical)).
:::

Past student performance *strongly* suggests that this is a good week to:

1. Catch up on readings, particularly the more *critical* ones and the ones focussing on the impact of Airbnb.
2. Go back over the first five notebooks in order to self-test and check your understanding. This doesn't mean re-doing the full notebook, but (for example) seeing if you can use `pandas` to analyse the simpler data we looked at in weeks 3 and 4.

Looking ahead to the [Group Work](../assessments/group.qmd), I'd *also* strongly suggest that you browse the [Full Reference List](../references.qmd) for ideas. The bibliography is a working document and I will add more items as and when I come across them or new works are published, but this is a good time to start reading about the ethical and practical issues arising from Airbnb's operations and the data to which we have access.

## Readings

We've deliberately refrained from more academic readings this week, so the following content was selected to be easily-digested and interesting in terms of the practical limitations of 'AI' tools and the ways in which they reproduce errors in our own thinking rather that offering neutral, 'objective' insight:

- [AI translation jeopardises Afghan asylum claims](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-translation-errors-afghan-refugees-asylum/)
- [An Iowa school district is using ChatGPT to decide which books to ban](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/an-iowa-school-district-is-using-chatgpt-to-decide-which-books-to-ban/)
- [Singapore's tech-utopia dream is turning into a surveillance state nightmare](https://restofworld.org/2021/singapores-tech-utopia-dream-is-turning-into-a-surveillance-state-nightmare/)

And here's a nice example of why it's *not* about the algorithm:
