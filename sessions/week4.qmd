## Overview

This week we will look at how frequently-used code can be packaged up in functions and libraries. This is the point at which we begin to engage with code in a more abstract way because we are increasingly interested in reusability and flexibility.

::: {.callout-important}

### Learning Objectives

1. To develop an understanding of code re-use through functions.
2. To develop an appreciation of the utility of packages and namespaces.

::: 

This week we also start to move beyond Code Camp, so although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we begin to put them together in a new way. The next two weeks are a critical transition between content that you might have seen before in Code Camp (see [Practical](#practical)) or other introductory materials, and the 'data science' approach.

## Preparatory Lectures

Come to class prepared to present/discuss:

| Session | Video | Presentation    | 
| :------ | :---- | :-------------- | 
| Functions | [Video]({{< var vids.functions >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.1-Functions.qmd) | 
| Decorators | [Video]({{< var vids.decorators >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.2-Decorators.qmd) | 
| Packages | [Video]({{< var vids.packages >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.3-Packages.qmd) | 

## Other Preparation

### Readings

Come to class prepared to discuss the following readings:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false

readings = {
  'Massey:1996': ['https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14702549608554458', True],
  'dignazio:2020ch3': ['https://ucl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9931206723604761&context=L&vid=44UCL_INST:UCL_VU2&lang=en&search_scope=UCLLibraryCatalogue&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=UCLLibraryCatalogue&query=any,contains,D%5C%27Ignazio%20Data%20Feminism&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9041340239229546206&offset=0', True, 'Ch.3'],
  'Smith:2010': ['https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/GLAE-wp-42.pdf', False]
}

print("| Citation | Article    | ChatGPT Summary |", end="\n")
print("| :------- | :--------- | :-------------- |", end="\n")

for k,v in readings.items():
  chapter = f'{v[2]} ' if len(v)==3 else ''
  summary = "[Summary](../readings/" + k.replace(':','-') + ".qmd)" if v[1] else "N/A"
  print(f"| @{k} {chapter}| [URL]({v[0]}) | {summary} |", end="\n")

```

### Study Guide

1. Reading Massey's seminal "Politicising space and place":
  - What are the two conflicting geographical imaginations at play in contemporary society? Explain their contradictory nature.
  - In the case study of 'high-tech' scientists, how do the 'power geometries' of work and home reflect gendered power relations?
2. Looking at D'Ignazio and Klein's "On Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints":
  - What does the "view from nowhere" concept mean in the context of data visualization, and why do they find it problematic?
  - How do they propose to address the limitations of data visualization? Describe their concept of "data visceralization" and its significance.
  - Why do they suggest that you shouldn't *never* use the 'god trick'?
3. With reference to Smith's "Valuing housing and green spaces":
  - How is the hedonic modelling method used to understand the relationship between green spaces and house prices?
  - Does this approach respect some of the positional aspects developed in the other readings, or is just another 'view from nowhere'?

### Connections

These are two of the more challenging readings this term, but they are critical to understanding what we are trying to teach you: it's *not* just about learning to code, it's about learning how to deploy code/quantitative methods to *support* your argument, while maintaining a keen eye on how bias -- in both the technical and the ethical senses -- can creep into your thinking and, consequently, your results!

## In-Person Lectures

In this week's session will provide additional detail on the assessments.

| Session | Video | Presentation    | 
| :------ | :---- | :-------------- | 
| More on the Assessments | In class | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.4-Assessments.qmd) |
| Group Working |   In class          | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.5-Group_Working.qmd)      |

## Practical

This week's practical will be looking at how functions (and variables) can be collected into resuable packages that we can either make ourselves or draw on a worldwide bank of experts -- I know who _I'd_ rather depend on when the opportunity arises! However, if you have *not yet completed Code Camp* (or were not aware of it!), then you will benefit *enormously* from tackling the following sessions:

- [Functions](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Functions.html)
- [Packages](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Functions.html)

::: {.callout-tip}
### Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Seeing how functions and decorators can help us to reuse code efficiently.
- Beginning to make use of packages to access/interact with data.

::: 

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-04-Reuse"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
