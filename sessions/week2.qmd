## Overview

This week we will be quickly covering the fundamentals of Python programming, while developing a critical appreciation of data science as an ongoing 'process' that calls for iterative improvement and deeper reflection. We will be contextualising computers within a wider landscape of geographical/spatial research. And we will be (briefly) reviewing the basics of Python with a focus on simple data structures. We're focussing here on how computers 'think' and how that differs from what you might be expecting as an intelligen human being!

### Learning Objectives

1. A review of basic Python syntax and operators.
2. An understanding of how none of this all that new.

::: 

So we will be contextualising all of this within the longer history of the study of geography (or planning!) through computation. I hope to convince you that many of the problems we face today are _not_ new and why that should encourage you to continue to do the readings!

## Readings

Come to class having read:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false

readings = {
  'Burton:1963': ['https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1963.tb00796.x'], 
  'Donoho:2017': ['https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734', True],
  'Franklin:2024': ['https://doi.org/10.1177/03091325231210512', True]
}

print("| Citation           | Article    |", end="\n")
print("| :----------------- | :--------- |", end="\n")

for k,v in readings.items():
  chapter = f'{v[2]} ' if len(v)==3 else ''
  print(f"| @{k} {chapter}| [URL]({v[0]}) |", end="\n")

```

### Study Guide

The following questions will help guide your reading and prepare you for class discussions:

1. Thinking about @Burton:1963, evaluate the impact of the "quantitative revolution" on the field of Geography.
  - How do Burton's views on the quantitative revolution differ from the perspectives presented in the more recent sources?
  - How has the relationship between geography and computing evolved over time?
  - Was the quantitative revolution a singular event or part of a more continuous process?
2. Thinking about @Donoho:2017's definition of data science...
  - What is the "Big Data" meme and why does Donoho find it misleading?
  - Explain Breiman's concept of the "two cultures" in data analysis.
  - What does Tukey argue are the three essential constituents of a science, and how does he apply them to the field of data analysis?
  - What are CTFs and how do they relate to the "predictive culture" of data analysis?
  - What are the six divisions of the Greater Data Science (GDS) framework?
3. According to @Franklin:2024... 
  - What are three recent developments that distinguish the current landscape of open software in quantitative methods from previous eras?
  - What are some of the emerging subfields within quantitative methods, and what common goal do they share?
  - The author argues that the rebranding of quantitative methods as "data science" or "analytics" can be beneficial in certain contexts. Explain these benefits.
  - What concerns are raised about the fragmentation of the quantitative methods community identity?
<!--
1. What is the main argument presented in "Housing and Inequality in London" by @Travers:2016? 
  - How does the report define "affordable housing" and what are the key challenges facing London's housing market?
  - What are the main drivers of inequality in London, and how do they intersect with housing issues?
  - What policy recommendations are proposed to address the housing crisis in London?
-->

### Connections

@Franklin:2024 offers another perspective on 'the discipline' of quantitative human geography and its heterogeneity, while @Donoho:2017 will give you context on how data science might differ from what's covered in Quantitative Methods. You might also find @Unwin:1980 useful for understanding why the practicals are set up the way they are and why we don't post 'answers' until a few days after the last practical group has completed its session. You should read @Burton:1963 while reflecting on @ArribasBel:2018 with a view to seeing that 'there is nothing new under the sun': we tend to think that the challenges we face now in terms of data volumes and complexity are novel, but *they are not*. Indeed, here's John Graham-Cumming keynoting a 2012 conference talking about the Lyons Tea Company and how its programmers invented Dykstra's shortest path algorithm more than 20 years before Dykstra did!

## Pre-Recorded Lectures

This week is very busy because we need to cover off the basics for those of you who were unable to engage with *Code Camp*, while recapping only the crucial bits for those of you who *were* able to do so.

Come to class having watched:

| Session | Video | Presentation | 
| :------ | :---- | :----------- | 
| Python: the Basics (Part 1) | [Video]({{< var vids.basics1 >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.4-Python_the_Basics-1.qmd) | 
| Python: the Basics (Part 2) | [Video]({{< var vids.basics2 >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.5-Python_the_Basics-2.qmd) |

## In-Person Lectures

In this week's session we will look at the *practices* of data scientists in the wider context of the arrival of LLMs.

## Practical

This week's practical requires you to have completed installation of the programming environment. Make sure you have [completed setup of the environment]({{< var module.sds >}}).

We will take you through the fundamentals of Python, including the use of simple^[*Note*: simple does *not* mean 'easy'! Just because we say something is 'basic' or 'simple' does *not* mean that we think it is straightforward for someone learning to code for the first time!] Boolean logic and lists. However, if you have *not yet completed Code Camp* (or were not aware of it!), then you will benefit *enormously* from tackling the following sessions:

1. [The Basics](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/The_Basics.html)
2. [Boolean Logic](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Boolean_Logic.html)
3. [Lists](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Lists.html)

To run the code for these sessions you can:

1. Follow the instructions for running these [in Google's Collaboratory](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/req/code_camp.html); or 
2. Create a new Notebook in Docker (`File` > `New` > `Notebook`) and copy+paste the code into new `Code` cells.

### Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Ensuring that you are set up with Git/GitHub
- Reviewing Python basics
- Reviewing Python lists and logic

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-02-Foundations_1"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")
