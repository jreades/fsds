title: "Numeric Data"
week: 6
---

## Overview

This week we will be introducing the use of the pandas library for data analysis and management through a focus on numeric data and its distribution(s). This marks a major shift from working with concepts (lists, dictionaries, functions, etc.) largely in isolation to encountering all of them together 'in the wild' as part of a full data science workflow. So we are moving from the acquisition of concepts to their integration in the same way that we will — over the course of these three sessions — be coming from data acquisition to data integration.

## Learning Objectives

1. An appreciation of how and why this module *differs* from (QM) CASA0007.
2. The beginnings of a more integrative understanding of foundational computer science concepts and the practice(s) of data science.
3. A basic understanding of data acquisition and manipulation in Python.

## Connections

Read @dignazio:2020 to highlight the importance of thinking about what a data set captures... and what it excludes. @Cox:2016 is also a first introduction to the underlying data that we'll be working with over the rest of term. @dignazio:2020 should be getting you thinking about how 'cleaning' is not just about hygiene but has real implications for what you can and will find in your data: data is often a lot less 'tidy' than `tidyr` might lead you think! You should almost *never* be claiming that your (social) data represents the 'universe' of behaviours or is somehow 'complete'.

## Practical

In this practical we will begin working with the InsideAirbnb data, which you will have briefly examined in CASA0005. This week we focus on the first 'class' of data in the data set: simple numeric columns. We will see how to use Pandas for (simple) visualisation and (the beginnings of) analysis. It is hoped that you will see how Pandas combines and builds on techniques that we've already seen: while Pandas is incredibly sophisticated, the underlying *concepts* have been covered in the preceding three weeks! At this point we will also begin to make use of Pandas functionality to subset and explore the data.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Seeing how Pandas is 'just' a sophisticated extension of what we've already done.
- Familiarising yourself with Pandas functionality.
- Performing basic data cleaning and exploration tasks (including visualisation).
- Selecting and aggregating data in pandas.

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-06-Numeric_Data"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")
