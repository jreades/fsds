title: "Spatial Data"
---

## Overview

This week we will be focussing on the use of the geopandas library for spatial data analysis and management through a focus on spatial data and its distribution(s). Geopandas will help to clarify how Object-Oriented design and inheritance processes work, while also allowing to interrogate and map the assigned data set(s). A critical concept that should be emerging here is that spatial and numerical data analyses are, fundamentally, just two different views of the same data.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.
2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.
3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.
4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Creating/working with geo-data in Python.
- Making maps with Python.
- Exploring the data visually.
