## Overview

In the first week we will be focussing on the supporting infrastructure for 'doing data science'. That is to say, we'll be dealing with the installation and configuration of tools such as GitHub and Docker which support replicable, shareable, and document-able data science. As a (free) bonus, the use of these tools also protects you against catastrophic (or the merely irritating) data loss thanks to over-zealous editing of code or content. You should see this as preparing the foundation not only for your remaining CASA modules (especially those in Term 2) but also for your post-MSc career.

## Learning objectives

1. A basic understanding of the data science 'pipeline'.
2. An understanding of how data scientists use a wide range of 'tools' to *do* data science.
3. A completed installation/configuration of these tools.
::: 

You should also see this session as connecting to _Quantitative Methods_ Week 1 content on 'setting quantitative research questions' since the [main assessment](../assessments/index.qmd) will require you to develop a data-led policy briefing. In other words, you'll need to map current policy on to one or more research questions that can be quantitatively examined using the tools and techniques acquired over the course of the term! While you don't need to start work on this yet, you should keep it in the back of your mind for when you come across readings/results that you'd like to explore in more detail.

## Other Preparation

Although none of these activities are *compulsory* in advance of the first session, they will help you to prepare for the coming weeks.

### Reading List

Please make time to read:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false

readings = {
  'ArribasBel:2018': ['https://doi.org/10.1111/gec3.12403', True],
}

print("| Citation           | Article    |", end="\n")
print("| :----------------- | :--------- |", end="\n")

for k,v in readings.items():
  chapter = f'{v[2]} ' if len(v)==3 else ''
  print(f"| @{k} {chapter}| [URL]({v[0]}) |", end="\n")

```

### Study Guide

The following questions will help guide your reading and prepare you for class discussions: 

1. Compare and contrast GIS, Geocomputation, and Geographical Data Science (GDS).
  - What are their core focuses and methodological approaches?
  - How do they differ in their relationship to technological change?
  - What are the unique contributions of GDS in the context of "big data" and the rise of data science?

### A Head Start on Setting Up

Getting your computer set up to code *does* take time and most of these preparatory activites are fairly straightforward... with a few exceptions noted below. If you are able to get these tools installed in advance then you can focus on the taught content in the first two practicals rather than also wrestling with an installation process. This will also give us more time to help you if you discover that you're one of the unlucky few for whom getting set up is a lot more work!

Complete as many of these activities as you can:

1. Go through the [computer health check]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/health.html).
2. Install the [base utilities]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/base.html).
3. Install the [programming environment]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/installation.html).

The last of these is the stage where you're most likely to encounter problems that will need our assistance, so knowing that you need our help in Week 1 means that you can ask for it much sooner in the practical!

## In-Person Lectures

In this week's workshop we will review the module aims, learning outcomes, and expectations with a general introduction to the course.

## Practical

This week's practical is focussed on getting you set up with the tools and accounts that you'll need to across many of the CASA modules in Terms 1 and 2, and familiarising you with 'how people *do* data science'. Outside of academia, it's rare to find a data scientist who works entirely on their own: most code is collaborative, as is most analysis! But collaborating effectively requires tools that: get out of the way of doing 'stuff'; support teams in negotating conflicts in code; make it easy to share results; and make it easy to ensure that everyone is 'on the same page'.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Getting you up and running with the coding and collaboration tools.
- Providing you with hands-on experience of using these tools.
- Configuring your programming environment for the rest of the programme.

:::{.callout-note}

To save a copy of notebook to your own GitHub Repo: follow the GitHub link, click on `Raw` and then `Save File As...` to save it to your own computer. Make sure to change the extension from `.ipynb.txt` (which will probably be the default) to `.ipynb`before adding the file to *your* GitHub repository.

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-01-Getting_Started"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
