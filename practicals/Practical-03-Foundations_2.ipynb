        "\n",
        "We have discussed how *functions* are a useful programming tool to\n",

        "Some steps in a program are done so many times by so many people that,\n",

        "gory details. Reading a file (even one on a computer halfway round the\n",

        "\n",
        "To a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site\n",

        "that’s sitting on your your local hard drive (e.g. on your desktop). To\n",
        "simplify things a great deal: the computer really just needs to know the\n",

        "file (*e.g.* http, https, ftp, local…) and then a clever programming\n",

        "of the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "In all cases – local and remote – you use the package to handle the hard\n",
        "bit of knowing how to actually ‘read’ data (because all files are just\n",
        "`1`s and `0`s of data) at the *device* level and then Python gives you\n",
        "back a ‘file handle’ that helps you to achieve things like ‘read a line’\n",
