More on this [next week](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week10.html#lectures). Also see how we drop some columns _at the point where we do the join_ by taking advantage of the fact that most pandas/geopandas operations return a _copy_ of the (Geo)DataFrame. That allows us to get back from the spatial join a neat, tidy data frame ready for further analysis. If you're struggling to make sense of this, try removing the `drop` operations and see what your data frame looks like afterwards.

But this little demonstration also shows (above) a more subtle issue: imbalanced data. There are far fewer hotels than there are private rooms, and far fewer of _those_ than there are entire home/apt listings in the sample.
