In order to get you started on your data science 'journey' you will need to follow the guidance provided on the pages we've linked to below from the [CASA Computing Platform]({{< var module.sds >}}) web site.

## Steps to Setting Up {#sec-requirements}

There are three steps for getting set up with the CASA Computing Platform:

1. Complete the [health check]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/health.html), which also includes our *recommendations* if you are considering buying a new computer when you start your studies. 
2. Installing and configuring the [basic utilities]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/base.html) that will enable you to install the programming platform. 
3. Installing and configuring [the required software]({{< var module.sds >}}setup/installation.html).

We also provide information about [Code Camp]({{< var module.camp >}}), which is a reasonably short, self-paced introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python.

### When Installation Fails

In an **emergency**, some of the earlier material in the module will work in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but this will make your life significantly harder. We are unable to provide support for this.

## Soft Skills

Over the years, based on student experience and feedback we have collected a range of advice that is not purely technical in nature. This section covers [managing distractions]({{< var module.sds >}}skills/attention.html), an introduction to [how to read]({{< var module.sds >}}skills/reading.html) (in the academic sense of reading journal articles and books for *meaning* and *relevance*) as well as [how to think]({{< var module.sds >}}skills/thinking.html) (in the sense of why the modules are the way they are and the importance of reflection), and [how to ask for help]({{< var module.sds >}}skills/help.html) (because that's what we're to do, but first you need to help yourself!).
