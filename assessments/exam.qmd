title: "Timed Open Book Exam"
---

This 'exam' (to be completed on {{< var assess.quiz-date >}} between {{< var assess.quiz-time >}} and worth {{< var assess.quiz-weight >}}) will be administered as a quiz through Moodle. Most questions require little or no coding, but for those where an answer that includes code (or where coding helps you to check your answer) you can use Docker or Python directly (as you like) to do your work. Include code only if instructed to do so in the question.

For the exam itself you have 1h 20m (2 hours with a relevant SORA) to submit your answers. The 'clock' runs for the window period of those with a SORA ({{< var assess.quiz-time >}}). *All* incomplete exams are closed at the end of the window. If you do not have a SORA all questions submitted more than 1h 20m after the start of the exam will be discarded.

## Expectations

As a general set of expectations:

- Any content covered prior to Reading Week may be encountered in the exam.
- The exam is 'open book', but there are *three* important limitations: 
  1. You may not obtain direct assisstance from another person (either in-person or online); 
  2. You may not *ask* questions relating to the exam on StackOverflow or other 'online help boards' (you *can* search for existing answers). 
  3. You *may* use ChatGPT or another LLM for help. 
- *However*, if you make use of an external resource (e.g. you search for and find relevant code on StackOverflow or use ChatGPT) you *must* acknowledge this (a template has been included in free text answers).
- Anyone found to have cheated on this submission will receive a mark of `0` and the resit assessment will involve producing an analysis in a timed context under direct supervision of module staff: you will be **required** to be present *in-person* for the resit (this is likely to be during the summer period) and will have to complete a set of coding tasks specified by the module leader.

In other words: don't do it.

Good luck!
