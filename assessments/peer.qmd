title: "Group Self-Evaluation"
---

This self- and peer-mark assessment ({{< var assess.peer-weight >}})  due {{< var assess.peer-date >}} (@{{< var assess.peer-time >}}) asks you to reflect *on the process* of 'doing data science' as part of a team, since this format is typical of real-world projects. Many companies (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.) employ an Agile project format in which teams undertake a 'Retrospective' at the end of a project in order to identify ways to improve how they work in the future. We are *not* asking you to do this as a group, but we hope that this will help you to develop as a budding analyst or data scientist.

## Format

You will be asked to score both yourself *and* the rest of the group on their contribution to the project. Keep in mind that someone who wrote the code may be more 'visible' than the person who ensured that the code was actually answering the question, and the fact that you're much more likely to be aware of your *own* contributions than you are of the contributions of others.

The guidance for this is:
