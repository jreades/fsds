In the midst of an election, a newspaper has broken the scandal of an advisor on social mobility to the Mayor having three homes, two of which are let on Airbnb (one of which is still council-owned housing!). The opposition has announced a plan to force all professional landlords to register their properties and face higher Council Tax rates saying that Airbnb is ‘out of control’ in the capital. The Mayor wants to understand the scale of the ‘problem’ and the likely impacts of the opposition's proposal so that they can either adopt it (and show how responsive they are) or demonstrate how poorly thought-through the opposition’s proposal is (and show that they’re not ready to govern). They have come to you---their team of crack data crunchers and advisors---for guidance in the form of a briefing, and are looking for evidence and visualisations that they can use in their campaign comms.
