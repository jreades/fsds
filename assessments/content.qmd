The *Content* is worth {{< var assess.group-writing-weight >}} of your module grade. The overall word limit for this assessment is **2,500 words**. We will only count the text that you've *added* to the final PDF. Headings, guidance, etc. do no count towards the total. References do. Please tidy up the template before submitting (i.e. delete the 'Code Examples' section and any guidance that is not relevant (i.e. 'Draft answer due...' and the 'Briefing' section).

# Set Questions

{{< include _questions.qmd >}}

{{< include ./_briefing_rubric.qmd >}}

# Additional Information

The briefing can be written without sophisticated modelling through the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)). 

Students may use data from more than one time period if they wish, but this is not required. You can see the available data sets [on Orca](https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk/~jreades/data/). 

## Style

This is _not_ an essay, and students who submit answers using a traditional essay style will see their overall mark impacted as a result. You must preserve the question/response format, and your responses should be readily-grasped by an intelligent, but non-technical audience. This doesn't mean that you don't need citations, but you should not employ an academic writing style. See the [examples](#examples) provided below for insights into how to write for a less technical audience.

There will also be opportunities to discuss the submission during the second half of term.

## Write for Your Audience

What makes writing a good briefing *hard*---and not just about writing good code---is finding the right balance of technical detail and high-level explanation: you can't just say 'here are the five types of accommodation we found...', but you *also* can't say 'we tested clustering solutions in the range 3--50 and found the optimal result at `k=12`...'

## Figures & Tables

While figures and tables can help to illustrate a key point, students should give careful consideration to the trade-offs involved: more figures may serve to illustrate your points but cause the reader to lose the thread of your argument and negatively impact the presentation mark.

Unless you are presenting (and citing) a figure from another source as part of your framing, all figures and tables used **must be generated by Python code cells** included in the markdown file. You may not modify or create figures in another application since this undermines the reproducibility of the analysis.

## Assumptions

It is highly likely that you will need to make substantial use of *assumptions* in developing your briefing for the Mayor. These should be plausible and, where possible, documented. For example (and using a randomly selected reference): 

> Based on @Travers:2016, we assume that the average visitor to London walks at a rate of 3m/s (180m/minute). We further assume that a 10-minute walk is reasonable, giving us a limit of 1,800m...

Or:

> We assume that tourists spend approximately £X/day in their local area [see, e.g., @Wachsmuth:2018], implying that each property generates a maximum of £Y/year in local spending (assuming continuous occupation). In practice, we adopt the approach of XXX (2019) to estimate occupancy from reviews to generate a more realistic impact of...

So you can see that neither of these requires more than a couple of citations to allow you to estimate some reasonable threshold for a metric of interest. This will be a lot simpler than trying to look up global tourist spending information or TfL travel stats. Yes, it's a rough-and-ready estimate, but it also doesn't pull the number out of thin air.

## Referencing

You will need to make use of BibTeX and Markdown referencing in Quarto. 'Hard-coded' references will not be considered.

## Referencing in Quarto 

Although you can create BibTeX entries by hand, you will probaly want to make use of [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io) (Mac) or [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org) (Mac/Windows). Zotero shuould also work to edit the BibTeX file.

In Google Scholar, if you want to add a reference to your BibTeX file there's an option in the `Cite` functionality to copy a BibTeX entry to the clipboard and then pasted this into BibDesk or JabRef.

## Examples

Although the following examples are all much longer than permitted under the assessment format, they are exemplary in their communication of data and key findings in a manner that is clear, straightforward, and well-illustrated using maps, charts, and tables. So they can help you to think about how best to present information for non-expert audiences:

1. Travers et al. (2016), *Housing and Inequality in London*, Centre for London; [URL](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/).
2. Bivens, J. (2019), *The economic costs and benefits of Airbnb*, Economic Policy Institute; [URL](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/).
3. Wachsmuth et al. (2018), *The High Cost of Short-Term Rentals in New York City*, Urban Politics and Governance research group, McGill University; [URL](https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/files/newsroom/channels/attach/airbnb-report.pdf).

### Longer Questions

Notice how these 'models' differ from a traditional essay format. So instead of *Introduction*, *Literature*, etc. you will see the evidence is developed in parallel with the background material. This format provides for more flexibility in style and presentation, though you will note that they all refer to a mix of academic and grey literature as well!

## Partial Bibliography

You will also want to expand on the [partial bibliography file](bio.bib) provided. This is by no means complete and you will need to find relevant work, but it gives you a good starting point for using a BibTeX file.
