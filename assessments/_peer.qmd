> Thinking about the many ways — visible and less visible — that a student can contribute to the success of a group project, please rank the contributions made by your team-mates towards the group project as well as provide any comments you feel are pertinent.  Write your comments in a professional and constructive way, as this will be seen by your peers afterwards, though commentators will remain anonymous. You also need to assess yourself!
