This is **group work** due {{< var assess.group-date >}} @ {{< var assess.group-time >}} that you will undertake in a small group of *no more* than four students. The project is intended to resemble real-world data science ways of working: you will be part of a small team thrown together at short notice, you will need to figure out how to work effectively, and you will need to jointly produce an output in which you have confidence. 

## Applying Your Knowledge

The focus of this assessment is therefore the student's ability to make use of concepts and methods covered in class as part of an **analytical process** to **support decision-making** by a non-expert. It is *not* necessary that you employ every technique covered in class. It *is* necessary that you **justify your choices, results, and conclusions** using relevant literature as needed.

So the assessment *may* be completed by drawing on the code written in the practicals and the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)) for examples of how much can be achieved in this way. However, it is likely that a *better* mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond *exactly* what was covered in class by connecting concepts and demonstrating a deeper understanding of how to apply what has been learned across FSDS, QM, and GIS to the problem at hand. 

## Two-Part Submission

The submission will have two parts and both are evaluated as part of your overall grade:

1. The runnable QMD (Quarto Markdown Document) file that produces the PDF submitted in the second part of the assessment. The QMD will be evaluated for its **reproducibility** and is worth {{< var assess.group-code-weight >}} of your module grade. See the [Code](./code.qmd) page for more guidance.
2. The rendered PDF file output by your QMD file in the first part of the assessment. This second part allows us to focus on the **content**, regardless of whether or not there are issues with its reproducibility, and is worth {{< var assess.group-writing-weight >}} of your module grade. See the [Contnent](./content.qmd) page for more guidance.

You can find both sets of guidance together in the [Rubric](./Rubric-Group.qmd).

Please also see [Resources](./resources.qmd) for the templates and information about how to create and render the QMD file.
