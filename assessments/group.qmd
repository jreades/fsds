## Data-Led Policy Briefing (50%)

This is a **collaborative project** that you will undertake in a small group of *no more* than three students. The project is intended to resemble real-world data science ways of working: you will be part of a small team, you will need to figure out how to work effectively together, you will need to jointly produce an output in which you all have confidence.

## Rationale

The focus of this assessment is the student's ability to make use of concepts and methods covered in class as part of an **analytical process** to **support decision-making in a non-academic context**. It is *not* necessary that you employ every technique covered in class. It *is* necessary that you **justify your *choice* of approach** with reference to relevant academic and 'grey' literature, as well as the computational, statistical, and analytical objectives of your briefing paper. It is perfectly possible to complete this assessment without the use of advanced analytical topics (e.g. clustering, NLP, or global/local/LISA autocorrelation methods); however, it is unlikely that you would be able to complete this assessment to a high standard without *some* graphs and *some* maps chosen for their ability to advance your argument.

The assessment *may* be completed *without* substantially new modelling or coding by drawing on the code written in practicals to develop an analysis based on the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)), but it is likely that a *better* mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond exactly what was taught by selectively deploying more advanced programming techniques.

## Group Disputes

In the event that there is *irreconcilable* disagreement within a group, we will use GitHub to determine contributions and inform individual marks.

Please pay careful attention to the submission process since this is unusually complex thanks to the limitations of Moodle. This assessment consists of _two_ separate submissions:

1. A **Reproducible Analysis** (40% of this assessment; i.e. 20% of module grade) consisting of a Jupyter notebook uploaded as a `.ipynb` file. There is no limit to the amount of code in the *Reproducible Analysis*. [See details](./code.qmd).
2. A **Policy Briefing** (60% of this assessment; i.e. 30% of module grade) consisting of a PDF generated from a Markdown document. The word limit for the *Policy Briefing* is 2,500 words. [See details](./briefing.qmd).
