# Briefing Rubric

You are advising the Mayor on how to respond to a political scandal involving Airbnb and housing. You will work in an information-poor environment, meaning that you'll need to make assumptions, justify them, and use creative reasoning to produce an evidence-informed and persuasive briefing.

Your task is to provide a short, well-evidenced briefing that answers the five set questions. You’ll be assessed not on finding the right answer (there isn’t one), but on how well you reason, justify, visualise, and communicate your analysis.

### Marking Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | What we will look for |
| :----------- | :---- | :------------------------ | 
| **Analytical reasoning & use of data** | 25% | How effectively, creatively, and defensibly you use data and assumptions to address the questions. Show that your analysis is logical and evidence-based, and that you understand the limits of your data. |
| **Clarity and persuasiveness of argument** | 25% | How clearly and convincingly you answer the five questions. Structure your argument logically, back up your points with evidence or reasoning, and show that you can weigh different perspectives. The goal is to brief a decision-maker, not write a long academic essay. |
| **Visualisation and communication** |	20% |	How effectively you use charts, tables, or visuals to tell the story. Visuals should be clear, relevant, and easy to read. The writing should be concise, professional, and appropriate for the Mayor and a policy audience. |
| **Policy and ethical insight** | 20% | How well you understand the bigger picture — the political, ethical, and social dimensions of the issue. Who wins or loses from the proposal? What are the trade-offs or unintended consequences? Show awareness of housing and data justice issues. |
| **Transparency and reflexivity** | 10% | How openly and thoughtfully you discuss your assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations. Explain how confident you are in your findings and how your assumptions might shape your conclusions. |

### Tips for Success

- Be creative, but stay realistic and justify the assumptions that you make, clearly explaining your reasoning.
- Your briefing feels professional and policy-ready, with visuals helping to strengthen your message. It looks like something the Mayor could actually use!
- Remember your audience: write for the Mayor, this is not a technical report.
- You show critical awareness of data gaps, politics, and ethics, and reflect honestly on uncertainty and what could be done better with more time or information.
- Think critically about 'control', 'professional landlord', and 'social mobility' because these are political ideas as much as analytical categories.
