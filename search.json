Depending on the nature of the conflict, these can be trivial or very, very hard to resolve. If you think about it, the obvious conflicts will broadly fall into three classes:\nMaking this all a lot harder is that a ‘change’ could be anything from a direct edit to a section of a line, to deleting a file or folder!

    "section": "Some Terminal Basics",
    "text": "Some Terminal Basics\nThroughout Foundations we will make regular use of the ‘Terminal’, also known as the ‘Command Line’ (CLI), on both Mac and PC. There will be a whole lecture on the CLI and why/how we use it, but becoming comfortable with text commands is like gaining a bonus super-power alongside your new programming skills: need to change a line of text or code in thirty files? No problem! Need to start up a new Podman container? Done! Need to see how much free memory your server has? Yep!\nThere are many different types of terminal out there, but we are currently recommending that you use the following:\n\nWindows users: you are very strongly encouraged to use the Windows Terminal instead of the ‘Power Shell’, though the latter will also work in a pinch. The ‘Command Prompt’ (cmd) does not work for our purposes.\nMacOS users: please try to use iTerm2 in preference to the built-in Terminal because it is easy to add additional usability features such as OhMyZSH, but it’s not essential that you do so.\n\nIn fact, you can also run OhMyZSH on Windows but it looks like you’re in for a bit of a long haul and might want to leave it for when you’ve done everything else this week.\nIf you need help understanding how to use the Command Line or want to be able to do much more there are a wide range of tutorials available.\nHere are some starting points for learning more:\n\nI need help understanding: Software Carpentries is your friend! They have an entire tutorial titled The Unix Shell.\nI still need help understanding: the Programming Historian is another good place to look! And they also have an entire tutorial titled An Introduction to Bash.\nI want to do more on the Command Line: O’Reilly has produced an online book called Data Science at the Command Line that will take you much, much further.\n\nTwo more things:\n\nPressing the ‘up’ arrow on your keyboard moves you back one step in your command history. This is massively useful when you want to run the same command again (e.g. the one to run Podman!) since it saves you looking it up or copy+pasting.\nTo close a Terminal window you can run the exit command. If you make changes to the Terminal configuration file you often need to open a new window to see your changes take effect."

For example, if you see cd &lt;directory&gt; (cd means change directory) then if you want to change to the Documents directory you should type cd Documents. If you see &lt;your username here&gt; you should type jreades if that’s your username. And so on. You do not include the &lt; or &gt; characters!\nSo, for example, if you see cd ~&lt;your username&gt; then you should type cd ~jreades (or whatever your username is). If you don’t know your username you can type whoami. After each of these commands you need to hit the Enter/Return key (⏎) in order to run the command."

This is where you will store your notebooks, data, and any other files that you need to work with. The ultimate structure we’ll produce this:\n\n\n\n‘Target’ Directory Structure\n\n\nOn both a Mac and a PC you should be able to run the following:\n\ncd $HOME – this will change directory to your home directory (on a Mac it will be /Users/&lt;your username&gt;, on a PC it will be something like C:\\Users\\&lt;your username&gt;). Hint: cd means ‘change directory’!\ncd Documents – this will move you into your ‘Documents’ folder. Note: on Windows this might be called My\\ Documents (the \\ is not a mistake, you need it when there’s a space in the name), in which case it’s cd My\\ Documents! If you have set up your computer in another language this might be called something else, but the Terminal should still ‘know’ which folder contains your documents.\nmkdir CASA – this will create a CASA folder in your home directory.\ncd CASA – you are now changing into the CASA directory.\necho $pwd (PC) or pwd (Mac) – this should show you the ‘full path’ to your new CASA directory (e.g. /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Documents/CASA or something like that).\n\nLeave the Terminal window open!

In particular, I’m interested in the formula for the volume of a sphere (and this gives me a chance to show that Notebooks can show formulae as well!):\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the Volume of a Sphere\nSo, given a sphere with a diameter of 12cm, calculate its volume:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI would strongly advise you to Google: python constant pi and look for code that will save you having to write down the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nfrom math import ??\nv = ??\nprint(f\"{v:0.3f} cm3\")\n\nI get an answer of 904.779cm\\(^3\\).\n\n\n\nCalculate the Radius of a Sphere\nNow, given a sphere of volume 14,137cm\\(^3\\) calculate its radius as a whole number. The formula for this can be worked out as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3}{4}V &= \\pi r^{3} \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{V}{\\pi} &= r^{3} \\\\\n(\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{V}{\\pi})^{1/3} &= r\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf you can’t remember how to rearrange formulae this would be a good skill to refresh!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are three ways to get a “whole number” from a float:\n\nWhen you’re starting out, the easiest is to change the variable’s type\nThe next step up is to make use of Google to find out if there are ways of rounding to the nearest integer\nThe third step is to change what’s visible to the user without altering the actual number\n\n\n\nI get an answer of either 14 or 15… can you work out why?\n\nQuestion\n\nfrom math import pi\nv = 14137\nr = ??\nprint(??)"

But first, some information about formatting number in Python…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFormatting Numbers\n\n\n\nWe often want to format numbers in a particular way to make the more readable. Commonly, in English we use commas for thousands separators and a full-stop for the decimal. Other countries follow other standards, but by default Python goes the English way. So:\n\nprint(f\"{1234567.25:.0f}\")\nprint(f\"{1234567.25:.1f}\")\nprint(f\"{1234567.25:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"{1234567:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"{1234567:,.2f}\")\n\n1234567\n1234567.2\n1234567.25\n1234567.00\n1,234,567.00\n\n\n\n\nThat should then help you with the output of the following block of code!\n\nQuestion\n\nfor l in listings:\n    ??\n\nThe output should be:\n\nThe nightly price of Sunny 1-Bed is £37.50\nThe nightly price of Fantastic Dbl is £46.00\nThe nightly price of Home-Away-From-Home is £125.00\nThe nightly price of Sunny Single is £45.00\nThe nightly price of Whole House is £299.99\nThe nightly price of Trendy Terrace is £175.00"

    "text": "What Do We Do? Break It Down!\n\nStep 1. Analyse the Problem\nThe first step to writing a program is thinking about your goal and the steps required to achieve that. We don’t write programs like we write essays: all at once by writing a whole lot of code and then hoping for the best when we hit ‘submit’. \nWhen you’re tackling a programming problem you break it down into separate, simpler steps, and then tick them off one by one. Doing this gets easier as you become more familiar with programming, but it remains crucial and, in many cases, good programmers in large companies spend more time on design than they do on actual coding.\n\n\nStep 2. Functions & Packages\nWe have discussed how functions are a useful programming tool to enable us to re-use chunks of code. Basically, a function is a way to do something to something in a portable, easy-to-use little bundle of code.\nSome steps in a program are done so many times by so many people that, eventually, someone writes a package that bundles up those operations into something easy to use that saves you having to figure out the gory details. Reading a file (even one on a computer halfway round the world) is one of those things. Making sense of the data in that file for you is probably not.\n\n\n\nxkcd: Easy vs. Hard\n\n\nTo a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site halfway around the world) is not really any different from reading one that’s sitting on your your local hard drive (e.g. on your desktop). To simplify things a great deal: the computer really just needs to know the location of the file and an appropriate protocol for accessing that file (e.g. http, https, ftp, local…) and then a clever programming language like Python will typically have packages that can kind of take of the rest.\nIn all cases – local and remote – you use the package to handle the hard bit of knowing how to actually ‘read’ data (because all files are just 1s and 0s of data) at the device level and then Python gives you back a ‘file handle’ that helps you to achieve things like ‘read a line’ or ‘close an open file’. You can think of a filehandle as something that gives you a ‘grip’ on a file-like object no matter where or what it is, and the package is the way that this magic is achieved.\n\n\nStep 3. Look for Ways to Recycle\nAlways look for ways to avoid reinventing the wheel. This is where Python’s packages (or R’s for that matter) come into their own. If it’s something that programmers often need to do, then chances are that someone has written a package to do it!\nThe point of packages is that they can help us to achieve quite a lot very quickly since we can just make use of someone else’s code. In the same way that we won’t mark you down for Googling the answer to a coding question, we also won’t mark you down for using someone else’s package to help you get going with your programming. That’s the whole point!\nOften, if you’re not sure where to start, Google (or StackOverflow) is the place to go:\nhow to read text file on web server python\nBoom!\n\n\nStep 4. Make a Plan\nOK, so we need to break this hard problem down into something simpler. We can do this by thinking about it as three separate steps:\n\nWe want to read a remote file (i.e. a text file somewhere the planet),\nWe want to turn it into a local data structure (i.e a list or a dictionary),\nWe want to perform some calculations on the data (e.g. calculate the mean, find the easternmost city, etc.).\n\nWe can tackle each of those in turn, getting the first bit working, then adding the second bit, etc. It’s just like using lego to build something: you take the same pieces and assemble them in different ways to produce different things."

    "text": "Understanding What’s an ‘Appropriate’ Data Structure\nIf you stop to think about it, then our list-of-lists approach to the data isn’t very easy to navigate. Notice that if the position or name of a column changes then we need to change our program every time we re-run it! It’s not very easy to read either since we don’t really know what u[5] is supposed to be. That way lies all kinds of potential errors!\nAlso consider that, in order to calculate out even a simple aggregate such as the sum of a field for all rows we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well: we have to write a for loop and then step through each row with an ‘accumulator’ (somewhere to store the total). That’s slow.\nThat doesn’t make much sense since this should all be easier and faster in Python than in Excel, but right now it’s harder, and quite possibly slower as well! So how does the experienced programmer get around this? ‘Simple’ (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans tend to think in rows of data: this apartment has the following attributes (price, location, etc.), or that city has the following attributes (population, location). We read across the row because that’s the easiest way for us to think about it. But, in short, a list-of-lists does not seem to be the right way to store this data!\nCrucially, a computer doesn’t have to work that way. For a computer, it’s as easy to read down a column as it is to read across a row. In fact, it’s easier, because each column has the same type of data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains prices (integers or floats), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often doesn’t matter as long as we know what the columns are called: it’s easier to ask for the ‘description column’ than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the description column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the ‘description’ label for the column itself."

That’s a handy way to make your code a little easier to read. If you’re creating a list and it’s getting a little long, then you can also continue a line using a , as well!\n\n1. The first f-string\nThe first string will help you to make sense of the second: f-strings allow you to ‘interpolate’ a variable into a string directly rather than having to have lots of str(x) + \" some text \" + str(y). You can write f\"{x} some text {y}\" and Python will automatically convert the variables x and y to strings and replace {x} with the value of x and {y} with the value of y.\nSo here f\"The town of {city} can be found at \" becomes f\"The town of Lerwick can be found at \" because {city} is replaced by the value of the variable city. This makes for code that is easier for humans to read and so I’d consider that a good thing.\n\n\n2. The second f-string\nThis one is hard because there’s just a lot of code there. But, again, if we start with what we recognise that it gets just a little bit more manageable… Also, it stands to reason that the only difference between the two outputs is that one asks for the ‘Longitude’ and the other for the ‘Latitude’. So if you can make sense of one you have automatically made sense of the other and don’t need to work it all out.\nLet’s start with a part that you might recognise:\n\nmyData['Name'].index(listing)\n\nYou’ve got this. This is just asking Python to work out the index of Lerwick (because city = 'Lerwick'). So it’s a number. 5 in this case. And we can then think, ’OK so what does this return:\n\nmyData['Longitude'][4]\n\nAnd the answer is -1.145. That’s the Longitude of Lerwick! There’s just one last thing: notice that we’re talking about degrees West here. So the answer isn’t a negative (because negative West degrees would be East!), it’s the absolute value. And that is the final piece of the puzzle: abs(...) gives us the absolute value of a number!\n\nhelp(abs)"

What would you get if you ran just this code?\n\nmyData['Longitude'][2]\n\nRemember that this is a dictionary-of-lists (DoL). So, Python first looks for a key named Longitude in the myData dictionary. It finds out that the value associated with this key is a list and, in this example, it just pulls out the second value (index 1). Does that part make sense?\nNow, to the second part:\n\nmyData['Name'].index('2 bedroom 8th floor serviced apartment.')\n\nHere we look in the dictionary for the key Name and find that that’s also a list. All we’re doing here is asking Python to find the index of ‘2 bedroom 8th floor serviced apartment.’ for us in that list. And myData['Name'].index('2 bedroom 8th floor serviced apartment.') gives us back a 2, so instead of just writing myData['Longitude'][2] we can replace the 2 with myData['Name'].index('2 bedroom 8th floor serviced apartment.')! Crucially, notice the complete absence of a for loop, which means that this code is fast!\nDoes that make sense? If it does then you should be having a kind of an 🤯 moment because what we’ve done by taking a column view, rather than a row view, is to make Python’s index() command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches ‘Name’ and then check to see if it’s ‘2 bedroom 8th floor serviced apartment.’, we’ve pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we also have the row number to go and do the lookup in the ‘Longitude’ column because the index is the row number!"

    "section": "The Easternmost Listing",
    "text": "The Easternmost Listing\nWhere this approach really comes into its own is on problems that involve maths. To figure out the easternmost city in this list we need to find the maximum Longitude and then use that value to look up the city name. So let’s do the same process of pulling this apart into two steps. Let start with the easier bit:\n\nmyData['Name'][0]\n\nThat would give us the name of a city, but we don’t just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the maximum longitude. To achieve that we need to somehow replace the 0 with the index of the maximum longitude. Let’s break this down further:\n\nWe first need to find the maximum longitude.\nWe then need to find the index of that maximum longitude.\n\nSo Step 1 would be:\n\nmax_lon = max(myData['Longitude'])\n\nBecause the max(...) helps us to find the maximum longitude in the Longitude list. Now that we have that we can proceed to Step 2:\n\nmyData['Longitude'].index(max_lon)\n\nSo now we ask Python to find the position of max_lon in the list. But rather than doing this in two steps we can combine into one if we write it down to make it easier to read:\n\nmyData['Longitude'].index(\n    max(myData['Longitude'])\n)\n\nThere’s the same .index which tells us that Python is going to look for something in the list associated with the Longitude key. All we’ve done is change what’s inside that index function to max(myData['Longitude']). This is telling Python to find the maximum value in the myData['Longitude'] list. So to explain this in three steps, what we’re doing is:\n\nFinding the maximum value in the Longitude column (we know there must be one, but we don’t know what it is!),\nFinding the index (position) of that maximum value in the Longitude column (now that we know what the value is!),\nUsing that index to read a value out of the Name column.\n\nI am a geek, but that’s pretty cool, right? In one line of code we managed to quickly find out where the data we needed was even though it involved three discrete steps. Think about how much work you’d have to do if you were still thinking in rows, not columns!\n\nloc = myData['Name'][\n    myData['Longitude'].index(\n        max(myData['Longitude'])\n    )\n]\nprint(f\"The easternmost listing is {loc}.\")\n\n\nThe Average Number of Bedrooms\nSo here we’re going to ‘cheat’ a little bit: rather than writing our own function, we’re going to import a package and use someone else’s function. The numpy package contains a lot of useful functions that we can call on (if you don’t believe me, add “dir(np)” on a new line after the import statement), and one of them calculates the average of a list or array of data.\n\nimport numpy as np\nprint(f\"The mean number of bedrooms is {np.mean(myData['Bedrooms'])}\")\n\nThis is where our new approach really comes into its own: because all of the population data is in one place (a.k.a. a series or column), we can just throw the whole list into the np.mean function rather than having to use all of those convoluted loops and counters. Simples, right?\nNo, not simple at all, but we’ve come up with a way to make it simple.\n\n\nRecap!\nSo the really clever bit in all of this isn’t switching from a list-of-lists to a dictionary-of-lists, it’s recognising that the dictionary-of-lists is a better way to work with the data that we’re trying to analyse and that that there are useful functions that we can exploit to do the heavy lifting for us. Simply by changing the way that we stored the data in a ‘data structure’ (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line!"

We’re going to start from this point.\n\nfrom urllib.request import URLError\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\ntry:\n    url = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk/~jreades/data/Listings.csv'\n    response = urlopen(url)\n    raw  = response.read()\n    data = raw.decode('utf-8')\n    with open('Listings.csv', 'w') as f:\n        f.writelines(data)\nexcept URLError as e:\n    print(f\"Unable to download data: {e}\")\n\n\n\nGetting Organised\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDifficulty level: Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take the code above and modify it so that it is:\n\nA function that takes two arguments: a URL and a destination filename.\nA function that checks if a file exists already before downloading it again.\n\nYou will find that the os module helps here because of the path function. And you will need to Google how to test if a file exists. I would normally select a StackOverflow link in the results list over anything else because there will normally be an explanation included of why a particular answer is a ‘good one’. I also look at which answers got the most votes (not always the same as the one that was the ‘accepted answer’). In this particular case, I also found this answer useful.\nI would start by setting my inputs:\n\nimport os\nurl = \"https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk/~jreades/data/Listings.csv\"\nout = os.path.join('data','Listings.csv') # Print `out` if you aren't sure what this has done!\n\n\n\nSketching the Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDifficulty level: Low, if you’ve watched the videos…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I would sketch out how my function will work using comments. And the simplest thing to start with is checking whether the file has already been downloaded:\n\nQuestion\n\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\ndef get_url(src, dest):\n    \n    # Check if dest exists -- if it does\n    # then we can skip downloading the file,\n    # otherwise we have to download it!\n    if os.path.isfile(??):\n        print(f\"{dest} found!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{dest} *not* found!\")\n        \nget_url(url, out)\n\n\n\n\nFleshing Out the Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDifficulty level: Medium\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you really explore what’s going on in the function rather than just running it and moving on.\n\n\n\nI would then flesh out the code so that it downloads the file if it isn’t found and then, either way, returns the local file path for our CSV reader to extract:\n\ndef get_url(src, dest):\n    \n    # Check if dest does *not* exist -- that\n    # would mean we had to download it!\n    if os.path.isfile(dest):\n        print(f\"{dest} found locally!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{dest} not found, downloading!\")\n        \n        # Get the data using the urlopen function\n        response = urlopen(src) \n        filedata = response.read().decode('utf-8')\n        \n        # Extract the part of the dest(ination) that is *not*\n        # the actual filename--have a look at how \n        # os.path.split works using `help(os.path.split)`\n        path = list(os.path.split(dest)[:-1])\n        \n        # Create any missing directories in dest(ination) path\n        # -- os.path.join is the reverse of split (as you saw above)\n        # but it doesn't work with lists... so I had to google how \n        # to use the 'splat' operator! os.makedirs creates missing \n        # directories in a path automatically.\n        if len(path) &gt;= 1 and path[0] != '':\n            os.makedirs(os.path.join(*path), exist_ok=True)\n        \n        with open(dest, 'w') as f:\n            f.write(filedata)\n            \n        print(f\"Data written to {dest}!\")\n    \n    return dest\n        \n# Using the `return contents` line we make it easy to \n# see what our function is up to.\nsrc = get_url(url, out)"

    "section": "Pathlib",
    "text": "Pathlib\nPathlib is intended to work around the fact that different Operating Systems represent paths on file systems in different ways. Using the os library there is quite a lot of ‘faff’ involved in managing this: whereas Unix, Linux, and the macOS (which is BSD Unix under the hood) use forward slashes in a path (e.g. /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Documents/...)1, Windows usess backslashes (e.g. C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\My Documents\\...). The differences don’t stop there, but that’s enough to see how life can get complicated; in os this is managed by the bundle of functions and constants under os.path and you can then use os.path.sep.join([&lt;a list representing a path on the computer&gt;]).\nPathlib does away with all of that. Remember that we’ve defined an object as a bundle of data and functions that act on the data. So the Path class is both data about a location on a computer and a set of functions that can manipulate that data. Let’s see what that means in practice:\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nhere = Path('.')\nprint(\"Using a directory: \")\nprint(f\"\\tHere: {here}\")\nprint(f\"\\tParents: {here.parents}\")\nprint(f\"\\tURI: {here.absolute().as_uri()}\")\nprint(f\"\\tIs directory: {here.is_dir()}\")\nprint(f\"\\tIs file: {here.is_file()}\")\nprint(f\"\\tParts: {here.resolve().parts}\")\nprint(f\"\\tDirectory contents: \\n\\t\\t{'\\n\\t\\t'.join([str(x) for x in list(here.glob('*.qmd'))[:3]])}...\")\n\nprint()\n\ntry:\n    fn = here / 'Practical-05-Objects.qmd' # Try changing the ending to html after running\n    print(\"Using a file:\")\n    print(f\"\\tResolved path: {fn.resolve()}\")\n    print(f\"\\tExists: {fn.exists()}\")\n    print(f\"\\tIs file: {fn.is_file()}\")\n    print(f\"\\tFile size (bytes): {fn.stat().st_size:,} bytes\")\n    print(f\"\\tOwner: {fn.owner()}\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found!\")\n\nHopefully you can now see how the object-oriented approach of pathlib allows to write neater, more readable code than the older os module? We no longer have to keep passing in a list or string representing a path on a specific operating system, we can just pass around Path objects and let Python take care of turning them into concrete paths on a computer when we need to ‘act’ on the Path in some way (check that it exists, create it, interrogate it, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUpdating…\n\n\n\nIn fact, I’m still updating the practicals to make full use of pathlib so you may find places where the older os approach is still in use. If you spot one of these why not submit an Issue or even fix it in a copy of the FSDS repor and then submit a Pull Request on GitHub to correct the code?"

For simplicity I’ve called this ‘testing’, but you could also think of it as ‘dev’ mode. What we want is to be able to easily swap between testing and operational contexts using a ‘switch’ (typically, a Boolean value) and limit the data load in testing mode.\nTo achieve this you could set pandas to:\n\nLoad only the first 10,000 rows using nrows if we are testing\nUse the columns specified in cols\nAllow pandas to load the entire data set before deciding on the column type by setting low_memory appropriately.\n\n\nRow Subsetting\nLet’s tackle the rows problem first:\n\nQuestion\n\ntesting = True\n\nif testing:\n    df = pd.read_csv(path, \n                low_memory=??, ??)\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(path, \n                low_memory=??)\n\nprint(f\"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]}\")\n\nSo notice how this code deliberately works the same for either testing or operational execution – we just flip between the option by changing the testing variable from True to False!\nTo make this more robust and useful we could use this testing variable throughout our code if we wanted to change other behaviours based on development/deployment context.

When that happens you can get very confusing issues because what you see doesn’t square with what the computer has executed. To resolve this without having to re-run the entire notebook (though that can also be a good choice!) you might want to ‘delete’ the current object and re-load or re-run the relevant data or code.\n\ndel(df)\n\nSo we use del(df) to ensure that we aren’t accidentally using the ‘old’ data frame.

So we can probably drop some of these rows, but one thing to do is look at the frequency of NaNs across the data frame first. So we need to look for NaNs and Nulls, but it’s quite obvious that a NaN in the listing id is a basic problem and we should drop these.\n\ndf[df.id.isna()][['id','name','price','room_type']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nname\nprice\nroom_type\n\n\n\n\n50163\nNaN\nhttps://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-...\n0\n3.0\n\n\n52261\nNaN\nhttps://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/7d57d...\n364\n5.0\n\n\n56509\nNaN\nhttps://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/652bf...\n4\n2.0\n\n\n77223\nNaN\nhttps://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3a51c...\n174\n2.0\n\n\n78241\nNaN\nhttps://a0.muscache.com/im/users/11520835/prof...\n19\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, if you don’t know that’s going on, break it down:\n\nYou have seen how column works ([[&lt;column names&gt;]]), so that’s just selecting the columns that we want to show;\nYou know how row selection works (df[&lt;selection criteria&gt;]), so that isn’t anything really new either;\nSo the only really new part is df.id.isna(): df.id is the id column (we could have written this df['id'] if we wanted) and isna() is a test for whether or not a value is NaN.\n\nSo this shows that only one row in the 10,000 row sub-sample has a NaN for its id.\nIf you’re not sure what the next line does, try breaking it down by running the inner bits before you run the drop command; and also try looking online for examples of how to use df.drop (e.g. just up above):\n\nprint(f\"Data frame contains {df.shape[0]:,} rows.\")\ndf.drop(df[df.id.isna()].index.array, axis=0, inplace=True)\nprint(f\"Data frame contains {df.shape[0]:,} rows.\")\n\nData frame contains 93,486 rows.\nData frame contains 93,481 rows.\n\n\nWith that really troublesome data out of the way, you can now turn to counting NaNs or Nulls in the remaining data with a view to identifying other rows that can probably be dropped.\n\n\nCounting Nulls by Column\nAs a starting point I would look to drop the columns that contain only NaNs. Remember that we’ve dropped a row from the data frame so our maximum is now \\(n-1\\))! Notice how this next command works:\n\n# returns a data frame with all values set to True/False according to Null status\ndf.isnull() \n# counts these values by column (we'll see another option in a moment)\ndf.isnull().sum(axis=0) \n# Sort results in descending order\ndf.isnull().sum(axis=0).sort_values(ascending=False) \n\n\ndf.isnull().sum(axis=0).sort_values(ascending=False)[:12]\n\nlicense                 93481\nhost_about              45684\nbeds                    32197\nbathrooms               32126\nprice                   32063\nfirst_review            24746\nreviews_per_month       24746\nlast_review             24746\nreview_scores_rating    24746\nhost_location           21192\nbedrooms                11686\ndescription              3189\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThe most obvious ones here are: license, host_about, beds, bathrooms.\n\ndf.drop(columns=['license','host_about'], inplace=True)\n\nBecause we have dropped everything inplace the code simply runs and doesn’t return anything.\n\n\nCounting Nulls by Row\nWe now know that there are still quite a few problems, but we do still need a way to identify the rows that are causing most of the problems.\nNotice here that the change from axis=0 to axis=1 changes the ‘direction’ of the sum from columns to rows. And we are getting back a data series because the summing operation reduces it to just one column.\n\ndf.isnull().sum(axis=1).sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)\n\n78240    23\n56508    23\n52260    23\n50162    23\n77222    23\n4801     14\n8322     14\n45832    14\n13539    14\n4684     14\ndtype: int64\n\n\nSo that Series shows how many NaN values there are by index value (i.e. the row number). The first column is the row id, the second is the number of NaNs in that row.\nIf we save the results to a variable called probs (i.e. problems) then we can decide what to do next.\n\nprobs = df.isnull().sum(axis=1)\nprint(type(probs))       # Note that this has returned a series!\nprobs.plot.hist(bins=30) # Oooooooh, check out what we can do with a series!\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this histogram, I would think about dropping rows missing more than about 5 values on the basis that they are the ones that are most likely be problematic. We can use the index from probs to select out the rows we want to inspect from the main data frame.\nHere’s another bit of code that bears unpacking:\n\nprint(f\"df contains {df.shape[0]:,} rows.\")\ncutoff = 5\ndf.drop(probs[probs &gt; cutoff].index, inplace=True)\nprint(f\"df contains {df.shape[0]:,} rows.\")\n\ndf contains 93,481 rows.\ndf contains 82,856 rows.\n\n\n\nprobs &gt; 5: this selects only those rows in the ‘probs’ series whose value is greater than 5\nprobs[...].index returns the index values from the Series, which we will then pass to the drop command.\ndf.drop(..., inplace=True) will then drop the rows selected by probs[probs&gt;5].index."

Some simple examples:\n\nA column containing only the strings 'True' (4 bytes) and 'False' (5 bytes) will take up vastly more space than a column containing only True and False (1 bit each).\nA column containing only 'Red', 'Green', and 'Blue' (3, 5, and 4 bytes each respectively) will take up much more space that a column where we use the numbers 1, 2, 3 to represent these values and have a map that tells us 1==Red, 2==Blue, and 3==Green.\n\nLet’s test this idea out before looking more closely at how to convert each type of data:\n\n# String type memory usage\nrtm = df.room_type.memory_usage(deep=True) \n# Categorical type memory usage\nctm = df.room_type.astype('category').memory_usage(deep=True) \n\nprint(f\"The raw memory usage of `room_type` is {rtm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"The categorical memory usage of `room_type` is {ctm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"That's {(ctm/rtm)*100:.0f}% of the original!\")\n\nThe raw memory usage of `room_type` is 5,741 Kb.\nThe categorical memory usage of `room_type` is 729 Kb.\nThat's 13% of the original!\n\n\n\n# String type memory usage\nshm = df.host_is_superhost.memory_usage(deep=True) \n# Boolean type memory usage\nbhm = df.host_is_superhost.replace({'f':False, 't':True}).astype('bool').memory_usage(deep=True) \n\nprint(f\"The raw memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is {shm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"The boolean memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is {bhm/1024:,.0f} Kb.\")\nprint(f\"That's {(bhm/shm)*100:.0f}% of the original!\")\n\nThe raw memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is 4,686 Kb.\nThe boolean memory usage of `host_is_superhost` is 728 Kb.\nThat's 16% of the original!"

    "text": "Saving Geo-Data Locally\n\nThink Storage Formats\nWe want to save the InsideAirbnb GeoDataFrame to the ‘geo’ directory, but first let’s see what file formats are supported.\n\n\n\nFormat\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\n\n\n\nShapefile\nWide support\nEasy to break via loss of individual file element and not very efficient format\n\n\nGeoJSON\nHuman-readable\nHighly inefficient storage format\n\n\nGeoPackage\nLightweight spatial database with benefits of indexing\nLightweight spatial database with limits on data types supported\n\n\nGeoParquet\nHighly compressed columnar database\nLimited GIS support (except QGIS), and DuckDB has issues.^[You can install the Spatial Extension.\n\n\n\nGeoPackages are really well-supported by QGIS: you can even embed multiple layers with different style information so that your final analysis is easy to distribute; however, they also carry quite a bit of overhead that makes them inefficient for distributing smaller data sets, while also not supporting the full spectrum of Pythonic data structures such as categorical data or lists.\nGeoParquet is an extension of the Parquet format. For working with large data sets this has revolutionised my workflow: getting excited about a columnar database might seem a bit… nerdy… but it’s been transformative for many data scientists. First, because the data set is columnar you only read in the data that you need, so reading Parquet file is blindingly fast. Second, you can stream data from a Parquet file over the Internet, so that means you even gain these advantages reading remote files. Third, you have full support for Python data types, including (up to a point) objects. And, fourth, you can treat multiple Parquet files with the same layout as a single data set or mutiple Parquet files with different layouts as tables in a single database!\n\n\nSpecifying a Driver\nSince there are many formats in which to save geo-data, rather than have multiple to_format_x methods, GeoPandas has tried to have one for local files (to_file). Normally, Geopandas will do the ‘right thing’ based on the extension: so if it sees .shp it will use the ESRI Shapefile driver, if it sees .gpkg it will use the Geopackage dirver, and the same for .geojson, etc.\nThere are two ways you may run into trouble:\n\nIf you are reading/writing a URL (e.g. https://github.com/jreades/…/src/Boroughs.gpkg?raw=true) where there is content after the .gpkg exten sion. If in doubt, specify the driver.\nIf you are reading/writing a Parquet file then you need to use to_parquet() and read_parquet() for compatibility with Pandas.\n\nSo why didn’t we need to do with the cache_data function earlier as well? Well, this was a side-benefit of using the standard URL library: it automatically stripped off the query string (?raw=true) when I asked it for the file name, so we saved the file locally as a GeoPackage with .gpkg extension, which means that GeoPandas could read it without any problems.\nSo the following two bits of code are equivalent:\n# Should be fine for local files but...\nboros.to_file('test.gpkg') \n# This is safer if working across multiple computers/the Internet\nboros.to_file('test.gpkg', driver='GPKG')\nYou may find that saving to a GeoPackage fails with a TypeError because of the presence of Categorical data in the geo-data frame. This behaviour seems to have changed recently so that it may no longer be an issue, but a ‘geoparquet’ file will not have this problem, so that’s another reason to use it!"

Do not think of Python’s output as being ‘maps’ in the GIS sense, they are composed of ‘patches’ of color on abstract ‘axes’ that can use any arbitrary coordinate space. So colours are ‘really’ numerical triplets (or quadruplets if you have transparency as well) in the range 0.0-1.0. Annotations are then added in similarly abstract fashion.\n\n\nNow that we’ve got our layers looking roughly how we want them, it’s time to combine them. This is also reliant on matplotlib and basically involves plotting items to shared axes which is done by passing in ax=&lt;axis object&gt; to each plot(...). By convention, if you only have a single figure (e.g. a single map) then you create an axis object and name it ax so you will see a lot of ax=ax code in graphing libraries, but =ax is just saying ‘assign to the axis object that I created’.\nSince the axes are how you control what is shown, see if you can find out by Googling how to set the x- and y-limits on the map so that it shows only London and trims out the much larger area of water that is outside of the Greater London Authority. As a rough guideline, this has the Easting range 501,000 to 563,000, and the Northing range 155,000 to 202,000.\nYou can set these limits before or after you start adding layers to the ‘map’, but it’s probably easier conceptually to add them after with the idea of ‘zooming in’ on the features of interest. It’s also easier to debug since you can start by seeing if you can plot the elements at all, and then add the limits to zoom.\nSo the steps are:\n\nWrite the code to plot every image on the same set of axes (I’ve given you something to get started).\nGoogle how to set the limits of the map and then use the ranges I’ve offered above.\nWork out how to change the width of the edges for the boroughs layer.\nSave it somewhere local so that you could, say, load it into a Markdown file!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is a first pass at a map, over the next few weeks we’ll see how to add things like axis labels and titles to make it more ‘map-like’. We don’t have quite the built-in functionality of ggplot alas, but Python is advancing very quickly in this area.

However, using transformations we can manipulate the data to increase its tractability for analysis. We saw several transformations last week (z-score, natural log, etc.).\nLet’s start by getting a feel for the full data set in terms of the range of prices that it contains:\n\nQuestion\n\nprint(f\"The range of price is ${??:,.2f} to ${??:,.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The mean and median of the price are ${??:,.2f} and ${??:,.2f}\")\n\nNotice the neat little comma-separated thousands in there? That’s fairly easy to do in English, but to use a thousands separator common to another language you would need to do something a little more tricky.\n\n\n\nInheritance!\nWe already know that GeoPandas inherits functionality from Pandas, but let’s formalise this…\nFirst, let’s check what class of object gdf is using the isinstance function:\n\n# Is gdf a GeoDataFrame object?\nif isinstance(gdf, gpd.GeoDataFrame): \n    print(\"\\tI'm a geopandas data frame!\")\n\n# Is gdf *also* a DataFrame object?\nif isinstance(gdf, pd.DataFrame): \n    print(\"\\tI'm a pandas data frame!\")\n\n\n\nBenefiting from Inheritance\nThat result means that we can also investigate the data using, for instance, a pandas histogram and here are two ways to look at the pricing data:\n\n# Oooooh, let's use a *pandas* method here\ngdf.price.plot.hist(bins=200, xlim=(0,1000), figsize=(8,3)); \n\n\n# Oooooh, let's use a *pandas* method here\ngdf[gdf.price &lt; 1000].price.plot.hist(bins=200, xlim=(0,1000), figsize=(8,3)); \n\n\nQuestion\nCan you explain why these two plots look very different?\nNotice how we’ve used our GeoDataFrame as if it’s a plain old DataFrame here? That’s the miracle of Object-Oriented Design: we can do anything we would with a regular Pandas df as we do with a GeoPandas gdf because GeoPandas inherits all the methods of its parent super-class.\nWe can see that there’s very little data above (at a guess) about $1,000, but at this scale it’s hard to tell. We’ve already seen that you can use axes limits to adjust the display of a map, but the same technique applies to plain old plots because they’re fundamentally the same thing in that they’re both matplotlib outputs.\nYou can do the same thing with a boxplot:\n\n\nQuestion\n\nax = gdf.price.plot.??(vert=False, figsize=(8,3))\nax.??\n\nMore complex formatting is also possible if you really know your pandas and your matplotlib:\n\ngdf.price.plot(kind='box', vert=False, \n             color=dict(boxes='r', whiskers='r', medians='r', caps='r'),\n             boxprops=dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=1.5),\n             flierprops=dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=1.5),\n             medianprops=dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=1.5),\n             whiskerprops=dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=1.5),\n             capprops=dict(linestyle='-', linewidth=1.5),\n             showfliers=False, grid=False, rot=0);"

This behaviour could easily trip up someone who is simply trying to find all LineStrings which have no points outside a given Polygon. In fact, this is probably the most common usage of contains.

If we have a problem of this type then it’s not serious and we should carry on. But if we have a problem that type then we need to stop what we’re doing right away.”\nSome of the intricacies of errors can seem quite confusing. What’s the point of having a finally (which we’ll get to in a moment), for instance? Well, if your application is connected to a database then finally gives your application a chance to disconnect cleanly (freeing up resources for the database) and even to rollback incomplete changes (e.g. a new user whose details were only partially inputted when the application crashed)."

This is recipe for failure. The Mythical Man Month comprehensively debunked this approach in 1975.\nThe general conclusion was that “Adding more people to a project that is late makes it later.” The reason this happens is that you cannot break a complex task into discrete parts, send someone away to work on it in isolation, and then have them report back at the end with a finished product. I have seen this happen in previous years’ group work too: one person did a lit review while someone else was writing code but they didn’t line up at the end!\nI saw this in graphic design too: a client writes a brief for exactly what they want. You deliver something exactly like what they asked for. And they say that’s not what they meant.\nThe Agile philosophy emerged in response to these kinds of failures, with the approach that the product should be finished as quickly as possible, but as provisionally as possible. So you always have a working application, even if it only does a fraction of what you intend for it to do in the long run.\nThis has been elevated by companies like Facebook to slogans along the lines of ‘Fail Fast’, but the point is to recognise as quickly as possible when something isn’t working or isn’t headed in the direction you planned.\nFor the group work at the heart of this module, the point of the iterative process that begins in Week 6 is to help you develop competency in using the tools required to make your submission, to start you thinking along the lines that are required for the more complex questions, and to tease out points of failure in the group’s ability to work together long before you are under the tight deadline at the end of term!\n\nSource: SimpleLearnSource: Northeastern University"

In other words, there is no iteration at all!\nAll data in a list is of the same type so we can easily add checks to make sure that it’s valid.\nWe can also easily calculate an average/max/min/median and so on (as we’ll see later) without even having to look at any other columns!\nWe can add more columns instantly and the process of finding something is just as fast as it is now. And adding more rows doesn’t make it much slower either!\n\nAlso, notice how in these two examples we don’t try to write the second example in one go: first, we work it out as a set of steps: how do we figure out what ‘row’ (position in the list) Tokyo is in? Now that we’ve got that, how do we retrieve the time zone value for Tokyo? We know that code works, now let’s do variable substitution, as we would if we were doing maths: we can replace the city_idx in the time zone lookup with ds2['name'].index('Tokyo')."

But that’s because it was all running on a server in New Jersey while I was in Manhattan. Everything was done using the Command Line and SSH (secure shell).\nMore recently, processing OSM data for the entire UK was possible on my MacBook Air using GDAL and bash scripts but not possible using R/RStudio directly. Basically, the work took so long (&gt; 13 hours) that RStudio thought the script had died and tried to kill it."

To make the first one more clear we might use (x * y)**2 / 3 or even ((x*y)**2)/3.\nAlso notice that with the two floats in the first block you do not always get the same result from operations that should give the same answer. Non-terminating decimals (e.g. 1/3) will always be rounded, unpredictably, by the computer because it doesn’t have infinite memory.

So randomness has high entropy. By extension, high concentration has low entropy (even if the result is surprising on the level of intuition: I wasn’t expecting to see that) because I can predict a 6 on the next roll of the dice fairly easy if all of my previous rolls were 6s."

A highly stylized computational, statistical, or mathematical model is demonstrated to exhibit the required statistical features, implying that the model explains the real-world phenomenon. Filling in the details of real-world mechanisms that explain why the model works can be done later by domain-specific experts.

There are many small, open source applications that do really useful but narrow things.\nWhen you have many people involved and they are working in an open environment then issues are often spotted spotted and solved more quickly. While this claim is open to some debate, there’s certainly no evidence that closed source code is any better than open source.\nA more interesting claim has to do with the potential for interested people to get involved in making code better – for instance, for some languages there may be very few translators available, leading private companies to simply ignore localisation; whereas for open source you can contribute the translation yourself! Or if you really think something isn’t working the way it should then you can offer up a solution that will make it better and, if the people running the project don’t agree, you can still do it and launch your own, competing project.\nFinally, many (though by no means all) open source projects are also free as free food, beer, or rides. If you have been taught to use ESRI’s ArcGIS or Microsoft Excel this seems crazy: how can you have free competition to those?

It can also help government to spot where there are problems.\nWe get increased efficiency and better service delivery if governments can look across departments or states to compare performance or enable others to turn up opportunities for improvement.\nCompanies can innovate off of government data: Land Registry and EPC data in the UK, for instance, give companies certainty that they won’t have to pay for this data and can build commercial products using it. The biggest gain here is in making government mapping data available.\nThere’s a strong assumption here that citizens are data literate, which I think doesn’t always hold; however, crime mapping, bus route mapping, and so on can help citizens to advocate for resources and support.\nGovernments can also save by not having to constantly respond to FOI requests or rebut other access requests from citizens and companies."

So before you run off and start writing some code, the first thing you need to do is understand the problem you’re trying to solve. That problem should not be technical, it should be practical.\nOnce you understand the problem you can start trying to code a solution.\nThe code will allow you to produce reports. These reports might be to do with data quality, they might be diagnostics from a Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm. At each stage in the development of your results you should be generating reports that help you to better-understand your problem and work out if your code is working.\nOnce the reports have given you confidence in your findings now you can actually write the analysis. Your analysis might lead you to realise that you need to go back and write more code and produce more reports, but that’s normal.\nFinally, you need to work out how to communicate your analysis. If you understand the problem then you’ll find this process rewarding. If you don’t then you’ll find it frustrating and want to brush it off quickly.\n\nSo the fact these are in a list is still rather misleading because at each point you get feedback effects, and it’s also a loop."

Everyone asks the server for the master copy, makes some changes, and then checks those changes back in.\nThis is not how Git works.\n\nThe way normal people approach this problem assumes that, usually, only one or two people are making changes. But how do you coordinate with 20 other people to find out who has the most recent copy then collect all 21 people’s changes?\nThe way developers used to approach this problem assumes that someone is in final charge. That a company or organisation runs a server which will decide whose changes are allowed, and whose are not."

    "text": "Aggregating the return\nThere is a lot to unpack here, and notice that it takes three steps to achieve our goal of selecting, grouping, aggregating, sorting, and printing out the ten most frequent combinations of room and property type, although we could reduce it to two if we really wanted to do so (at the cost of some legibility).\nAverage time per call of about: 0.32253\nI get an average time per call of about: 0.32207\nHopefully the first two steps are fairly clear, so let’s focus on the final one:\n\nGroup By\nThis is a reasonably intelligible step in which we group the data loaded by room and property:\n\ndfg = df.groupby(\n        by=['room_type','property_type'],\n        observed=True\n    )\ndfg\n\nThe order here matters: groupby(by=[&lt;A&gt;,&lt;B&gt;]) does not return the same result as groupby(by=[&lt;B&gt;,&lt;A&gt;]). Try it:\n\ndf.groupby(\n        by=['property_type','room_type'],\n        observed=True\n    )\n\nThe other thing to note here is the observed=True. This is a nice bit of additional functionality that, if you set it to False will return a number for all possible combinations, inserting a zero if that combintaion is not observed in the data. That’s useful if non-observations (i.e. there was no data for this group) is relevant to your data presentation or subsequent modelling/statistical tests1.\n\n\nAgg\nThe agg step aggregates the data specified in the functions:\n\ndfg.agg(\n        freq = (\"property_type\", \"count\"),\n        median_price = (\"price\", \"median\"),\n)\n\nPandas offers a lot of different ways to do this, but the above approach is perhaps the most flexible since we are telling Pandas to apply the count function to the property_type field and assign it to a column called freq, and to apply the median function to the price field and assign that to a column called median_price.\n\n\n‘Degroup’\nIn order to do anything further with the aggregated data you will almost always want to convert your GroupedDataFrame back to a regular DataFrame and that means resetting the index reset_index() – this is just one of those things to learn about grouped data in Pandas.\n\n\nSort\nFinally, to sort the data you need to sort_values, where by specifies the fields you want to sort on and ascending is a matching (optional) list that specifies the sort order for each sort column. If you just want to sort everything in ascending order then you don’t need to specify the ascending values, and if you wanted to sort everything in descending order then it’s just ascending=False."

We aren’t going to get into things like windowing functions or stored procedures here, but even simple aggregates done in DuckDB can vastly improve on the performance of pandas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you aggregate data you need to retrieve every column in the SELECT portion that you GROUP BY in the WHERE portion of the query.

There are quite a few changes to the query here so it’s worth reviewing them in more detail:\nSELECT property_type, room_type, \n    COUNT(*) AS freq, MEDIAN(price) AS median_price\nFROM read_parquet('{pqt}') \nWHERE price &lt; 1000 \nAND number_of_reviews &gt; 0\nGROUP BY room_type, property_type\nORDER BY frequency DESC, room_type, property_type\nLIMIT 10;\nKey things to note:\n\nWe have two new aggregate functions:\n\nCOUNT(*) returns a count of the number of rows in each group specified in the GROUP BY clause. We don’t need to specify a column here because * means ‘all rows’.\nMEDIAN(price) returns, unsurprisingly, the median value of the price column for each group specified in the GROUP BY clause.\nNote also the AS frequency which ‘renames’ the column returned by the query; it’s the same concept as the import x as y in Python.\n\nGROUP BY is where the aggregation happens, and here we’re asking DuckDB to take all of the rows selected (WHERE price &lt; 1000 AND number_of_reviews &gt; 0) and group them using the room_type and property_type fields.\nORDER BY orders the returned records by the columns we specify, and they can be either ASCending (the default) or DESCending (descending).\n\nWhat you should also be noting here is that:\n\nThis query returns very quickly compared to the pandas equivalent.\nWe have been able to express our selection, grouping, and organising criteria very succinctly.\n\nIn terms of both speed and intelligibility, there can be quite substantial advantages to moving some of your workflow into a database or a database-like format such as Parquet and then querying that from Python. Databases are designed for the kind of application that Pandas struggles with, and if you get to windowing functions and stored procedures you’ll see how there are situations where something is far easier to express in Python/Pandas than in SQL.\nSo the trick here is to recognise when you are facing a problem that: a) will benefit from being expressed/tackled in a different language; and b) won’t create undue overhead on your technology ‘stack’. In working with environmental and built environment data I was able to cut the processing time by 80% when I moved the bulk of the data linkage work from Pandas into Parquet+DuckDB. But, by the same token, what’s the point of using Postgres and managing a spatial database to perform a single step in a much longer workflow unless the performance considerations are so massive they outweigh any other issue."

So if you say that the selection should only be of MSOAs within London then you actually need to think about whether a shared border qualifies as ‘within’. Watch the lectures again if you’re unsure, but that’s why here we take this slightly clunky approach of buffering the London boundary before doing the selection.\n\n\n\nUnion\nAs we don’t have a boundary file for London, we can generate use using the union operator (as we do here) or using the dissolve() approach. Consider the pros and cons of each approach in terms of performance, output format, and legibility.\nSo here’s approach 1, which is a method call returning a GeoDataFrame (which is why we can call plot):\n\nboros.dissolve().plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s approach 2, which is an attribute and returns a raw polygon (so no reason to call plot, but it’s come back without the rest of the data frame!):\n\nboros.union_all()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🔗 Connections\n\n\n\nNotice how we’re also demonstrating some additional ways of plotting ‘on the fly’ (without generating a data frame) as well as (below) showing you how to zoom in/out."

This is another reason that you need to pay close attention to the differences between spatial and non-spatial joins.\n\n\n\n\nBuffer and Join\nIn order to ensure that we get all the MSOAs within London we need to buffer the boundary by some amount to ensure that within returns what we want. If cover were easier to use then that option might be preferable.\n\nQuestion\n\nldn['buffered'] = ldn.geometry.???(???)\nldn = ldn.set_geometry('buffered').set_crs(epsg=27700)\nax  = ldn.plot(facecolor=(.5, .5, .9, .5))\nmsoas.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor=(.6, .6, .6, .6))\nax.set_xlim(500000, 515000)\nax.set_ylim(180000, 195000);\n\nBy default we want do an inner join because we want to drop everything that doesn’t line up between the two data sets (i.e. don’t keep the thousands of other non-London MSOAs).\n\n\nQuestion\n\nldn_msoas = gpd.sjoin(msoas, ldn, predicate='???', how='inner')\nldn_msoas.plot()\n\nYour result should be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\nIf your plot above looks like the output from pandas and not geopandas then the list of columns and the documentation for set_geometry might help you to understand what is going wrong:\n\nprint(\", \".join(ldn_msoas.columns.to_list()))\n\nMSOA11CD, MSOA11NM, LAD11CD, LAD11NM, RGN11CD, RGN11NM, USUALRES, HHOLDRES, COMESTRES, POPDEN, HHOLDS, AVHHOLDSZ, geometry, index_right, geometry_right\n\n\nIt’s important to recognise that join and sjoin are not the same even though they may effectively perform the same function. An issue can arise if we join two geodata frames using the join function from pandas. The latter doesn’t know anything about spatial data and we can therefore ‘lose track’ of the geometry column. Worse, there are actually two geometry columns now, so we need to tell Geopandas which one to use!\nThe easiest way to do this is to simply rename the geometry we want and then set is as the active geometry. Here’s the code to use if you have a geometry_left column and aren’t able to show a map:\n\nldn_msoas = ldn_msoas.rename(columns={'geometry_left':'geometry'}).set_geometry('geometry')\nldn_msoas.drop(columns='geometry_right', inplace=True)\n\nWe also no longer really need to keep the full MSOA data set hanging about.\n\ntry:\n    del(msoas)\nexcept NameError:\n    print(\"msoas already deleted.\")\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCan you explain why the outputs of the dissolve and union_all look differnet? And use that as the basis for explaining why they are different?\n\n\nAnswer 1\n\n\nHow do you know that the units for the buffering operation are metres? 250 could be anything right?\n\n\nAnswer 2\n\n\nWhy do we need to buffer the London geometry before performing the within spatial join?\n\n\nAnswer 3"

This structure is why matplotlib is so much nastier than ggplot, but it does also give you greater control over the output if you really dig into the guts of things.\n\n\nOne of the reasons that Matplotlib is so much more complex than ggplot is that it can actually do a lot more than ggplot, including image manipulation, axis translation, and even 3D. You can get a sense of this by looking at the tutorials since the Users guide can be a bit overwhelming.\nNevertheless, the core components of all matplotlib figures can be seen here:"

    "section": "Finding Fonts",
    "text": "Finding Fonts\nI find matplotlib’s use of fonts to be profoundly weird. If you use conda and install directly on to the computer then you might have access to all of your computer’s fonts (though there are different types of fonts as well, not all of which will show up), but for most users it will be those that were installed into Podman.\n\nListing Fonts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDepending on how you are running the notebook, you may not be able to see all of the fonts available on your system. If the notebook is running in a Podman container it only has access to the fonts that are installed in the container. In other words: don’t panic if you don’t see the font(s) you want..\n\n\n\nfrom matplotlib import font_manager\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML\n\nflist = font_manager.findSystemFonts()\nnames = []\nfor fname in flist:\n    try:\n        names.append(font_manager.FontProperties(fname=fname).get_name())\n    except RuntimeError:\n        pass # Think the issue is emoji-support/colour fonts\n\nprint(f\"Found {len(set(names))} fonts.\")\n\ndef make_html(fontname):\n    return f\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: {fontname}; font-size: 18px;'&gt;{fontname}&lt;/p&gt;\"\n\ncode = \"\\n\".join([make_html(font) for font in sorted(set(names)) if not font.startswith('.')])\n\nHTML(\"&lt;div style='column-count: 2;'&gt;{}&lt;/div&gt;\".format(code))\n\nFound 42 fonts.\n\n\nBig Shoulders Display\nCousine\nDejaVu Sans\nEB Garamond\nFont Awesome 5 Brands\nFont Awesome 5 Free\nFont Awesome 6 Brands\nFont Awesome 6 Free\nFont Awesome v4 Compatibility\nHanken Grotesk\nInconsolata\nInconsolata Condensed\nInconsolata Expanded\nInconsolata ExtraCondensed\nInconsolata ExtraExpanded\nInconsolata SemiCondensed\nInconsolata SemiExpanded\nInconsolata UltraCondensed\nInconsolata UltraExpanded\nInter Tight\nLeague Gothic\nLiberation Mono\nLiberation Sans\nLiberation Serif\nLobster\nMicro 5\nRoboto Flex\nRoboto Mono\nRoboto Slab\nSilkscreen\nSource Code Pro\nSource Sans 3\nSource Sans Pro\nSource Serif 4\nSource Serif 4 18pt\nSource Serif 4 36pt\nSource Serif 4 48pt\nSpectral\nSpectral SC\nUbuntu\nUbuntu Condensed\nUbuntu Mono\n\n\n\n\nUsing Fontconfig\nfontconfig is the base Linux utility for managing fonts. We can list font using fc-list and then a set of ‘switches’ determining the kind of information we want back. Since fontconfig doesn’t exist on OSX or Windows, you’ll need to do some more investigating and poking around to get these details on a conda install (I’ll show an option further down)…\nHere we ask fontconfig to format the output so that we only get the first part of the family name, and then we pipe (recall | sends output from one utility to another!) the output of that to sort, which sorts the output, and uniq which removes duplicates (which there will be because there are bold, italic, small-caps, etc. versions of each font). To make better sense of this you can always try playing around with all three steps in the output below!\n\nfonts = ! fc-list --format=\"%{family[0]}\\n\" | sort | uniq\nprint(fonts[:5])\n\n['Big Shoulders Display', 'Bitstream Charter', 'Courier', 'Cousine', 'DejaVu Sans']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCapturing output\n\n\n\nNotice that we’re able to capture the output of an external application (called via the Terminal) with fonts = ! .... This can be useful when something is easy to do on the command line but hard to do in Python.\n\n\nThe below option also pipes output from fonctconfig, but to the grep utility which checks each line for the character sequence Liberation. Now we’re asking fontconfig to include style details which will relate to both weight (regular, bold, extra bold, light, etc.) and italic, bold, small caps, etc.\n\nfonts = ! fc-list : family style | grep \"Liberation\"\nprint(sorted(fonts)[:5])\n\n['Liberation Mono:style=Bold', 'Liberation Mono:style=Bold Italic', 'Liberation Mono:style=Italic', 'Liberation Mono:style=Regular', 'Liberation Sans:style=Bold']\n\n\nYou can find more examples here, a more detailed set of instructions here, and even information about (for example) supported languages based on RFC 3066.\nHere are the languages supported by the Ubuntu Light font:\n\nlangs = ! fc-list \"Liberation Mono\" : lang\nprint(sorted(langs)[:5], \"...\")\n\n[':lang=aa|ab|af|ast|av|ay|az-az|ba|bm|be|bg|bi|bin|br|bs|bua|ca|ce|ch|chm|co|cs|cu|cv|cy|da|de|el|en|eo|es|et|eu|fi|fj|fo|fr|ff|fur|fy|ga|gd|gl|gn|gv|ha|haw|he|ho|hr|hu|ia|ig|id|ie|ik|io|is|it|kaa|ki|kk|kl|ku-am|kum|kv|kw|ky|la|lb|lez|ln|lt|lv|mg|mh|mi|mk|mo|mt|nb|nds|nl|nn|no|nr|nso|ny|oc|om|os|pl|pt|rm|ro|ru|sah|sco|se|sel|sh|shs|sk|sl|sm|sma|smj|smn|sms|so|sq|sr|ss|st|sv|sw|tg|tk|tl|tn|to|tr|ts|tt|tw|tyv|uk|uz|ve|vi|vo|vot|wa|wen|wo|xh|yap|yi|yo|zu|ak|an|ber-dz|crh|csb|ee|fat|fil|hsb|ht|hz|jv|kab|kj|kr|ku-tr|kwm|lg|li|mn-mn|ms|na|ng|nv|pap-an|pap-aw|qu|quz|rn|rw|sc|sg|sn|su|ty|za|agr|ayc|bem|dsb|lij|mfe|mhr|miq|mjw|nhn|niu|rif|sgs|szl|tpi|unm|wae|yuw'] ...\n\n\nHere are the monospace fonts installed:\n\nmonos = ! fc-list :spacing=mono : family | sort | uniq\nprint(sorted(monos)[:5], \"...\")\n\n['Courier', 'Cousine', 'Inconsolata', 'Inconsolata Condensed', 'Inconsolata Condensed,Inconsolata Condensed Black'] ...\n\n\n\n\nFontdicts\nNow that we know what’s available, the next step is to set up some useful defaults that we can re-use across multiple plots to ensure consistency of output. The format for specifying fonts on a per-figure basis is a dictionary, so where you see fontdict in the matplotlib documentation the following should work:\nHere’s the example:\n\nfont = {'family': 'serif',\n        'color':  'darkred',\n        'weight': 'normal',\n        'size': 16,\n        }\n\n\nff='Liberation Sans'\ntfont = {'fontname':ff}\nbfont = {'fontname':ff, 'weight':'bold', 'horizontalalignment':'left'}\nafont = {'fontname':ff}\n\nI am setting the ‘title font’ (tfont) and ‘body copy font’ (bfont) and ‘axis font’ (afont) here to use in the output below. You can pick another font and see what happens.\n\n\n2.3: Using Fonts\nAt this point we’re going to work towards a kind of ‘atlas’ that would make it easy to compare some features for different London boroughs. I basically implemented a the basic matplotlib version of QGIS’ Atlas functionality.\n\n# This will be whatever LA you processed last week\nLA = 'Waltham Forest'\n\n\nmsoa_gdf = gpd.read_parquet(os.path.join('data','geo',f'{LA}-MSOA_data.geoparquet'))\n\n\nmedian_gdf  = msoa_gdf[['MSOA11CD','median_price','geometry']]\nlisting_gdf = msoa_gdf[['MSOA11CD','listing_count','geometry']]\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nThe Defaults\nHere is a demonstration of some of the ways you can adjust features in a Python matplotlib plot. I’m not suggesting either of these is a good output, but that’s not the point! The idea is to see the various ways you can tweak a plot… And notice that we’ve not yet changed any fonts. And it shows.\n\n# Set up a 1 x 2 plot (you can also leave off the nrows= and ncols=)\nf,axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(8,6))\n# ax1 will be the first plot on the left, ax2 will be on the right;\n# a 2 (or more) *row* plot will return a list of lists... 1 list/row.\nax1 = axes[0]\nax2 = axes[1]\n\n# Left plot is the median price\nmedian_gdf.plot(column='median_price', ax=ax1, legend=True, cmap='viridis')\nax1.set_title(\"Median Price per MSOA\");\n# Turn off the frame, one side of the plat at a time\nax1.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax1.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax1.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)\nax1.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\n# Set the labels\nax1.set_xlabel(\"Easting\");\nax1.set_ylabel(\"Northing\");\n\n# Right plot is the number of listings; note\n# here the use of both zorder (which is the \n# 'stacking order' of elements on the plot, and\n# the legend_kwds (keywords) to change the \n# orientation of the plot to horizontal\nlisting_gdf.plot(column='listing_count', ax=ax2, legend=True, cmap='plasma', zorder=1, \n                 legend_kwds={\"orientation\": \"horizontal\"})\nax2.set_title(\"Count of Listings per MSOA\");\n# Set a background colour for the plot\nax2.set_facecolor((.4, .4, .4, .2))\n# Add grid lines and set their zorder to\n# below that of the data on the plot\nplt.grid(visible=True, which='major', axis='both', color='w', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, zorder=0)\nax2.set_axisbelow(True)\n\n# This is equivalent to the ax1.spines... \n# above, but if you use it here you lose\n# the background to the plot as well!\n#plt.gca().set(frame_on=False)\n\n# Remove the labels on the ticks of the \n# axes (meaning: remove the numbers on \n# x- and y-axes).\nax2.set_xticklabels([])\nax2.set_yticklabels([])\n\n# Set the labels\nax2.set_xlabel(\"Easting\");\nax2.set_ylabel(\"Northing\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving on Defaults\n\nf,axes = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,6))\n\n# Set up the plots\nmedian_gdf.plot(column='median_price', ax=axes[0], legend=True, cmap='viridis')\nlisting_gdf.plot(column='listing_count', ax=axes[1], legend=True, cmap='plasma')\nfor ax in axes:\n    ax.axis('off')\n    # Note that here, set_facebolor doesn't work,\n    # presumably because the axis is 'off'\n    ax.set_facecolor((.4, .4, .4, .2))\n\n# Add the 'super-title', but notice that it is not \n# longer either centered (x=0.025) or centre-aligned\n# (horizonal alignment=left).

    "section": "Accessing MultiIndexes",
    "text": "Accessing MultiIndexes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDifficulty: Moderate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulty is conceptual, not technical.\n\n\n\nUntil now we have understood the pandas index as a single column-like ‘thing’ in a data frame, but pandas also supports hierarchical and grouped indexes that allow us to interact with data in more complex ways… should we need it. Generally:\n\nMultiIndex == hierarchical index on columns\nDataFrameGroupBy == iterable pseudo-hierarchical index on rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🔗 Connections\n\n\n\nWe’ll be looking at Grouping Data in much more detail in next week, so the main thing to remember is that grouping is for rows, multi-indexing is about columns.\n\n\n\nDirect Access\nOf course, one way to get at the data is to use .iloc[...] since that refers to columns by position and ignores the complexity of the index. Try printing out the the first five rows of the first column using iloc:\n\nexcel_atlas.iloc[???]\n\nYou should get:\n0    E02000001\n1    E02000002\n2    E02000003\n3    E02000004\n4    E02000005\nName: (Unnamed: 0_level_0, Unnamed: 0_level_1, MSOA Code), dtype: object\n\n\nNamed Access\nBut to do it by name is a little trickier:\n\nexcel_atlas.columns.tolist()[:5]\n\nNotice how asking for the first five columns has given us a list of… what exactly?\n\nQuestion\nSo to get the same output by column name what do you need to copy from above:\n\nexcel_atlas.loc[0:5, ???]\n\nThe answer is really awkward, so we’re going to look for a better way…\n\n\n\nGrouped Access\nDespite this, one way that MultiIndexes can be useful is for accessing column-slices from a ‘wide’ dataframe. We can, for instance, select all of the Age Structure columns in one go and it will be simpler than what we did above.\n\nexcel_atlas.loc[0:5, ('Age Structure (2011 Census)')]\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Levels\nThis works because the MultiIndex tracks the columns using levels, with level 0 at the ‘top’ and level 2 (in our case) at the bottom. These are the unique values for the top level (‘row 0’):\n\nexcel_atlas.columns.levels[0]\n\nThese are the values for those levels across the actual columns in the data frame, notice the repeated ‘Age Structure (2011 Census)’:\n\nexcel_atlas.columns.get_level_values(0)[:10]\n\nAnd here are the values for the second level of the index (‘row 1’ in the Excel file):\n\nexcel_atlas.columns.get_level_values(1)[:10]\n\nBy extension, if we drop a level 0 index then all of the columns that it supports at levels 1 and 2 are also dropped: so when we drop Mid-year Estimate totals from level 0 then all 11 of the ‘Mid-year Estimate totals (2002…2012)’ columns are dropped in one go.\n\nexcel_atlas[['Mid-year Estimate totals']].head(3)\n\n\ntest = excel_atlas.drop(columns=['Mid-year Estimate totals'], axis=1, level=0)\n\nprint(f\"Excel source had {excel_atlas.shape[1]} columns.\")\nprint(f\"Test now has {test.shape[1]} columns.\")\n\n\n# Tidy up if the variable exists\nif 'test' in locals():\n    del(test)\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat data type is used for storing/accessing MultiIndexes?\nWhy is this is the appropriate data type?\nHow (conceptually) are the header rows in Excel are mapped on to levels in pandas?"

    "text": "Tidying Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDifficulty level: Low\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there’s a lot of dealing with column names.\n\n\n\n\nDropping Named Levels\nThere’s a lot of data in the data frame that we don’t need for our Airbnb work, so let’s go a bit further with the dropping of column-groups using the MultiIndex.\n\nto_drop = ['Mid-year Estimate totals','Mid-year Estimates 2012, by age','Religion (2011)',\n           'Land Area','Lone Parents (2011 Census)','Central Heating (2011 Census)','Health (2011 Census)',\n           'Low Birth Weight Births (2007-2011)','Obesity','Incidence of Cancer','Life Expectancy',\n           'Road Casualties']\ntidy = excel_atlas.drop(to_drop, axis=1, level=0)\nprint(f\"Shape of the MSOA Atlas data frame is now: {tidy.shape[0]} x {tidy.shape[1]}\")\n\nShape of the MSOA Atlas data frame is now: 984 x 111\n\n\nThis should drop you down to 984 x 111. Notice below that the multi-level index has not changed but the multi-level values remaining have!\n\nprint(f\"There are {len(tidy.columns.levels[0].unique())} categories.\") # The categories\nprint(f\"But only {len(tidy.columns.get_level_values(0).unique())} values.\") # The actual values\n\n\n\nSelecting Columns using a List Comprehension\nNow we need to drop all of the percentages from the data set. These can be found at level 1, though they are specified in a number of different ways so you’ll need to come up with a way to find them in the level 1 values using a list comprehension…\nI’d suggest looking for: “(%)”, “%”, and “Percentages”. You may need to check both start and end of the string. You could also use a regular expression here instead of multiple tests. Either way works, but have a think about the tradeoffs between intelligibility, speed, and what you understand…\n\nQuestion\nSelection using multiple logical tests:\n\nto_drop = [x for x in tidy.columns.get_level_values(1) if (???)]\nprint(to_drop)\n\nSelection using a regular expression:\n\nprint([x for x in tidy.columns.get_level_values(1) if re.search(???, x)])\n\nEither way you should get a set of columns that ‘look’ like duplicates because we’re unpacking the top level of the hierarchical index: (only the first 10 are shown here):\n\n1: Percentages\n2: Percentages\n3: Percentages\n4: Percentages\n5: Percentages\n6: White (%)\n7: Mixed/multiple ethnic groups (%)\n8: Asian/Asian British (%)\n9: Black/African/Caribbean/Black British (%)\n10: Other ethnic group (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🔗 Connections\n\n\n\nSee how regular expressions keep coming baaaaaaaaack? That said, you can also often make use of simple string functions like startswith and endswith for this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop by Level\nYou now need to drop these columns using the level keyword as part of your drop command. You have plenty of examples of how to drop values in place, but I’d suggest first getting the command correct (maybe duplicate the cell below and change the code so that the result is saved to a dataframe called test before overwriting tidy?) and then saving the change.\n\nQuestion\n\ntidy = tidy.drop(to_drop, axis=1, level=???)\nprint(f\"Shape of the MSOA Atlas data frame is now: {tidy.shape[0]} x {tidy.shape[1]}\")\n\nThe data frame should now be 984 x 76. This is a bit more manageable though still a lot of data columns. Depending on what you decide to do for your final project you might want to revisit some of the columns that we dropped above…\n\n\n\nFlattening the Index\nAlthough this ia big improvement, you’ll have trouble saving or linking this data to other inputs. The problem is that Level 2 of the multi-index is mainly composed of ‘Unnamed’ values and so we need to merge it with Level 1 to simplify our data frame, and then merge that with level 0…\n\ntidy.columns.values[:3]\n\nLet’s use code to sort this out!\n\nnew_cols = []\nfor c in tidy.columns.values:\n    \n    #print(f\"Column label: {c}\")\n    l1 = f\"{c[0]}\"\n    l2 = f\"{c[1]}\"\n    l3 = f\"{c[2]}\"\n    \n    # The new column label\n    clabel = ''\n    \n    # Assemble new label from the levels\n    if not l1.startswith(\"Unnamed\"):\n        l1 = l1.replace(\" (2011 Census)\",'').replace(\" (2011)\",'').replace(\"Household \",'').replace(\"House Prices\",'').replace(\"Car or van availability\",'Vehicles').replace(' (2011/12)','')\n        l1 = l1.replace('Age Structure','Age').replace(\"Ethnic Group\",'').replace('Dwelling type','').replace('Income Estimates','')\n        clabel += l1\n    if not l2.startswith(\"Unnamed\"):\n        l2 = l2.replace(\"Numbers\",'').replace(\" House Price (£)\",'').replace(\"Highest level of qualification: \",'').replace(\"Annual Household Income (£)\",'hh Income').replace('Whole house or bungalow: ','').replace(' qualifications','')\n        l2 = l2.replace('At least one person aged 16 and over in household has English as a main language',\"1+ English as a main language\").replace(\"No people in household have English as a main language\",\"None have English as main language\")\n        clabel += ('-' if clabel != '' else '') + l2\n    if not l3.startswith(\"Unnamed\"):\n        clabel += ('-' if clabel != '' else '') + l3\n    \n    # Replace other commonly-occuring verbiage that inflates column name width\n    clabel = clabel.replace('--','-').replace(\" household\",' hh').replace('Owned: ','')\n    \n    #clabel = clabel.replace(' (2011 Census)','').replace(' (2011)','').replace('Sales - 2011.1','Sales - 2012')\n    #clabel = clabel.replace('Numbers - ','').replace(' (£)','').replace('Car or van availability','Vehicles')\n    #clabel = clabel.replace('Household Income Estimates (2011/12) - ','').replace('Age Structure','Age')\n    \n    new_cols.append(clabel)\n\nThe new columns should be:\nMSOA Code, MSOA Name, Age-All Ages, Age-0-15, Age-16-29, Age-30-44, Age-45-64, Age-65+, Age-Working-age, Households-All Households, Composition-Couple hh with dependent children, Composition-Couple hh without dependent children, Composition-Lone parent hh, Composition-One person hh, Composition-Other hh Types, White, Mixed/multiple ethnic groups, Asian/Asian British, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British, Other ethnic group, BAME, Country of Birth-United Kingdom, Country of Birth-Not United Kingdom, Language-1+ English as a main language, Language-None have English as main language, Tenure-Owned outright, Tenure-Owned with a mortgage or loan, Tenure-Social rented, Tenure-Private rented, Household spaces with at least one usual resident, Household spaces with no usual residents, Detached, Semi-detached, Terraced (including end-terrace), Flat, maisonette or apartment, Population Density-Persons per hectare (2012), Median-2005, Median-2006, Median-2007, Median-2008, Median-2009, Median-2010, Median-2011, Median-2012, Median-2013 (p), Sales-2005, Sales-2006, Sales-2007, Sales-2008, Sales-2009, Sales-2010, Sales-2011, Sales-2011.1, Sales-2013(p), Qualifications-No, Qualifications-Level 1, Qualifications-Level 2, Qualifications-Apprenticeship, Qualifications-Level 3, Qualifications-Level 4 and above, Qualifications-Other, Qualifications-Schoolchildren and full-time students: Age 18 and over, Economic Activity-Economically active: Total, Economic Activity-Economically active: Unemployed, Economic Activity-Economically inactive: Total, Economic Activity-Unemployment Rate, Adults in Employment-No adults in employment in hh: With dependent children, Total Mean hh Income, Total Median hh Income, Vehicles-No cars or vans in hh, Vehicles-1 car or van in hh, Vehicles-2 cars or vans in hh, Vehicles-3 cars or vans in hh, Vehicles-4 or more cars or vans in hh, Vehicles-Sum of all cars or vans in the area, Vehicles-Cars per hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionStop\n\n\n\nMake sure you understand what is happening here before just moving on to the next thing.

We also used the lambda function in the context of apply so this is just another chance to remind yourself how this works. This is quite advanced Python, so don’t panic if you don’t get it right away and have to do some Googling…\n\n\nWe want to add the borough name and a ‘subregion’ name. We already have the borough name buried in a separate column, so step 1 is to extract that from the MSOA Name. Step 2 is to use the borough name as a lookup to the subregion name using a lambda function. The format for a lambda function is usually lambda x: &lt;code that does something with x and returns a value&gt;. Hint: you’ve got a dictionary and you know how to use it!\n\nAdd Boroughs\nWe first need to extract the borough names from one of the existing fields in the data frame… a regex that does replacement would be fastest and easiest: focus on what you don’t need from the MSOA Name string and replacing that using a regex…\n\nQuestion\n\ntidy['Borough'] = tidy['MSOA Name'].???\ntidy.Borough.unique()\n\nYou should get:\narray(['City of London', 'Barking and Dagenham', 'Barnet', 'Bexley',\n       'Brent', 'Bromley', 'Camden', 'Croydon', 'Ealing', 'Enfield',\n       'Greenwich', 'Hackney', 'Hammersmith and Fulham', 'Haringey',\n       'Harrow', 'Havering', 'Hillingdon', 'Hounslow', 'Islington',\n       'Kensington and Chelsea', 'Kingston upon Thames', 'Lambeth',\n       'Lewisham', 'Merton', 'Newham', 'Redbridge',\n       'Richmond upon Thames', 'Southwark', 'Sutton', 'Tower Hamlets',\n       'Waltham Forest', 'Wandsworth', 'Westminster'], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nMap Boroughs to Subregions\nAnd now you need to understand how to apply the mapping ot the Borough field using a lambda function. It’s fairly straightforward once you know the syntax: just a dictionary lookup. But as usual, you might want to first create a new cell and experiment with the output from the apply function before using it to write the Subregion field of the data frame…\n\nmapping = {}\nfor b in ['Enfield','Waltham Forest','Redbridge','Barking and Dagenham','Havering','Greenwich','Bexley']:\n    mapping[b]='Outer East and North East'\nfor b in ['Haringey','Islington','Hackney','Tower Hamlets','Newham','Lambeth','Southwark','Lewisham']:\n    mapping[b]='Inner East'\nfor b in ['Bromley','Croydon','Sutton','Merton','Kingston upon Thames']:\n    mapping[b]='Outer South'\nfor b in ['Wandsworth','Kensington and Chelsea','Hammersmith and Fulham','Westminster','Camden','City of London']:\n    mapping[b]='Inner West'\nfor b in ['Richmond upon Thames','Hounslow','Ealing','Hillingdon','Brent','Harrow','Barnet']:\n    mapping[b]='Outer West and North West'\n\n\nQuestion\n\ntidy['Subregion'] = tidy.Borough.apply(???)\n\n\n\n\nAnd Save\nThere’s a little snipped of useful code to work out here: we need to check if the clean directory exists in the data directory; if we don’t then the tidy.to_parquet() call will fail.\n\nmsoas = Path('data/clean/MSOA_Atlas.parquet')\nif not msoas.parent.exists():\n    msoas.parent.mkdir()\ntidy.to_parquet(msoas.resolve())\nprint(\"Done.\")\n\nDone.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat are the advantages to apply and lambda functions over looping and named functions?\nWhen might you choose a named function over a lambda function?"

Or to put it another way… You can always calculate z-scores for your data (it’s just a formula applied to data points), but their intuitive meaning is lost if your data don’t have something like a normal distribution (or follow the 68-95-99.7 rule).\nBut… what if our data are non-normal? Well, Just because data are non-normal doesn’t mean z-scores can’t be calculated (we already did that above); we just have to be careful what we do with them… and sometimes we should just avoid them entirely.\n\nCreating a Normal Distribution\nBelow is a function to create that theoretical normal distribution. See if you can understand what’s going and add comments to the code to explain what each line does.\n\ndef normal_from_dist(series): \n    mu = ???          # mean of our data\n    sd = ???          # standard deviation of our data\n    n  = ???          # count how many observations are in our data\n    s = np.random.normal(???, ???, ???)   #use the parameters of the data just calculated to generate n random numbers, drawn from a normal distributions \n    return s                   #return this set of random numbers\n\nTo make it easier to understand what the function above is doing, let’s use it! We’ll use the function to plot both a distribution plot with both histogram and KDE for our data, and then add a second overplot distplot to the same fig showing the theoretical normal distribution (in red). We’ll do this in a loop for each of the three variables we want to examine.\n\n\nVisual Comparisons\nLooking at the output, which of the variables has a roughly normal distribution? Another way to think about this question is, for which of the variables are the mean and standard deviation most appropriate as measures of centrality and spread?\nAlso, how would you determine the meaning of some of the departures from the normal distribution?\n\nselection = [x for x in df_train.columns.values if x.startswith('Composition')]\n\nfor c in selection:\n    ax = sns.kdeplot(df_train[c])\n    sns.kdeplot(normal_from_dist(df_train[c]), color='r', fill=True, ax=ax)\n    plt.legend(loc='upper right', labels=['Observed', 'Normal']) # title='Foo'\n    ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain')\n    if ax.get_xlim()[1] &gt; 999999:\n        plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhich, if any, of the variables has a roughly normal distribution?

Alos note that there is strong evidence of some incipient structure: Inner East and West largely clump together, while Outher East and Outer South also seem to group together, with Outer West being more distinctive. If you look back at the PCA Components (especially #1) you might be able to speculate about some reasons for this!

Sometimes we have a label that we can use as part of the process (in which case we’re doing classification), and somtimes we don’t (in which case we’re doing clustering). But what defines similarity and difference? There is no one answer to that question and so there are many different ways to cluster or classify data, each of which has strengths and weaknesses that make them more, or less, appropriate in different contexts."

    "text": "What’s the ‘Right’ Number of Clusters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDifficulty: Moderate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more than one way to find the ‘right’ number of clusters. In Singleton’s Geocomputation chapter they use WCSS to pick the ‘optimal’ number of clusters. The idea is that you plot the average WCSS for each number of possible clusters in the range of interest (2…n) and then look for a ‘knee’ (i.e. kink) in the curve. The principle of this approach is that you look for the point where there is declining benefit from adding more clusters. The problem is that there is always some benefit to adding more clusters (the perfect clustering is k==n), so you don’t always see a knee.\nAnother way to try to make the process of selecting the number of clusters a little less arbitrary is called the silhouette plot and (like WCSS) it allows us to evaluate the ‘quality’ of the clustering outcome by examining the distance between each observation and the rest of the cluster. In this case it’s based on Partitioning Around the Medoid (PAM).\nEither way, to evaluate this in a systematic way, we want to do multiple k-means clusterings for multiple values of k and then we can look at which gives the best results…\n\nkcldf = cldf.drop(columns=['Dimension 1','Dimension 2'])\n\n\nRepeated Clustering\nLet’s try clustering across a wider range. Because we repeatedly re-run the clustering code (unlike with Hierarchical Clustering) this can take a few minutes. I got nearly 5 minutes on a M2 Mac.\n\n%%time \n\n# Adapted from: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html\n\nx = []\ny = []\n\n# For resolutions of 'k' in the range 2..40\nfor k in range(2,41):\n    \n    #############\n    # Do the clustering using the main columns\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, n_init=25, random_state=42).fit(kcldf)\n    \n    # Calculate the overall silhouette score\n    silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(kcldf, kmeans.labels_)\n    \n    y.append(k)\n    x.append(silhouette_avg)\n    \n    print('.', end='')\n\n\n\nPlot Silhouette Scores\n\nprint()\nprint(f\"Largest silhouette score was {max(x):6.4f} for k={y[x.index(max(x))]}\")\n\nplt.plot(y, x)\nplt.gca().xaxis.grid(True);\nplt.gcf().suptitle(\"Average Silhouette Scores\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n**&#9888; Note**: Had we used the UMAP dimensions here you'd likely see more instability in the silhouette plot because the distribution is not remotely Gaussian, though a lot depends on the magnitude of the columns and the number of UMAP vs. PCA components.\n\n\nWe can use the largest average silhouette score to determine the ‘natural’ number of clusters in the data, but that that’s only if we don’t have any kind of underlying theory, other empirical evidence, or even just a reason for choosing a different value… Again, we’re now getting in areas where your judgement and your ability to communicate your rationale to readers is the key thing."

As a budding data scientist/analyst your job is just as much to understand your audience and their needs: you will work with clients who can’t really articulate what they want or why, so good project management often involves putting yourself in your client’s shoes and working out how to translate what they say they want into what they actually need.\nYou will therefore do poorly on the assessments if you do not do the readings, watch the pre-recorded lectures, or participate in discussions (both online and in-person during practicals and classes).

You may not modify or create figures in another application since this undermines the reproducibility of the analysis.\n\n\nA/B Figures\nA figure with A/B/C elements will count as one figure, but only where the parts parts are conceptually related (e.g. before/after; non-spatial/spatial distribution; type 1 and type 2; etc.). The output from PySAL’s LISA analysis library, for instance, is pre-formatted as 3 figures. Seaborn’s jointplot will only be considered to be one plot even though it is technically three because the distribution plots in the margin are related to the scatter plot that is the focus of the plot.\nIn principle, a briefing with 16 figures would have no space for any text or interpretation; this choice is deliberate because its purpose is to focus your attention on which charts and tables best-communicate your findings. In practice, using A/B/C figure layouts then you are looking at up to 48 separate figures before hitting the limit, though you would at this point be producing an infographic and not a briefing.",

We further assume that a 10-minute walk is reasonable, giving us a limit of 1,800m…\n\nOr:\n\nWe assume that tourists spend approximately £X/day in their local area (see, e.g., Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018), implying that each property generates a maximum of £Y/year in local spending (assuming continuous occupation). In practice, we adopt the approach of XXX (2019) to estimate occupancy from reviews to generate a more realistic impact of…\n\nSo you can see that neither of these requires more than a couple of citations to allow you to estimate some reasonable threshold for a metric of interest.

The module seeks to enable students to access, understand, and communicate data in a spatial context. FSDS is not about pushing buttons, but about using logic, programming, and your growing analytical skills to tackle real-world problems in a creative, reproducible, and open manner.\nFSDS is not easy: in order to make the most of the module—and the foundation that it provides both for Term 2 modules on the MSc and for post-Masters employment—you will need to work hard. This does not mean cramming before each practical, it means practicing between practicals, doing the readings, and really watching the videos. UCL expectations for a Masters-level module is 150 hours of study time: there are 4 hours of timetabled activity per week, and about an hour of videos to watch before each workshop, leaving up to 100 hours of ‘self-study’. By implication, you should expect to spend about 1.25 hours/day studying for this module: reading, coding, and (above all) practicing.\nIn exchange for your hard work, there is a pressing need for analysts, planners, and geographers able to think computationally using programming, analytics, and data manipulation skills that are anchored in the needs of policy-makers, businesses, and non-profits. There is a severe skills shortage in this domain across all sectors and, consequently, significant opportunity for those who can ‘make sense’ of data+code."

How do their approaches to data collection, cleaning, and analysis reflect different values and priorities? What are the ethical implications of these choices, and how do they relate to the concept of “epistemic violence”?\nThe dominant metaphors used to describe data scientists, such as “unicorns,” “wizards,” and “rock stars,” can reinforce power imbalances in data work. Analyze the implications of these metaphors, and discuss how alternative framings of data science labor could promote more collaborative and equitable practices.\n\n\nReading Etherington (2016) reflect on:\n\n\nWhy does Etherington advocate for teaching GIS programming to geographers using an open-source Python approach?\nDescribe the six core spatial concepts that Etherington uses to structure his GIS programming course and reflect on whether they improve our understanding of both. \n\n\nCollectively:\n\n\nThe sources highlight a tension between the need for “clean” data in analysis and the potential for data cleaning to obscure diversity. Consider specific examples from the sources that illustrate this tension, and analyze how different approaches to data cleaning might impact the representation of ‘outliers’ in the data (be they marginalised groups, or extreme values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections\n\n\n\nD’Ignazio and Klein (2020b, Ch.5) will hopefully help you to reorient your thoughts on what it is that data scientists do (are they rock stars or janitors or something else?), while Etherington (2016) will help you to see how spatial and programming concepts can be connected to one another to improve our understanding of both. For a particularly good example of this see the GIS Algorithms text (Xiao 2016).\n\n\nWe’re now going to shift our focus slightly towards more critical takes on data and data science. These are not by people who can’t ‘do’ data science, rather they point to ways in which neither the data, nor the people who process them, are neutral or objective in the way that we often like to think they are.",

So we begin by covering how data can be aggregated in Python using Pandas before turning to the practical challenges of classification (labeled data) and clustering (unlabeled data).\nWe hare now ‘completing’ the pipeline begun in Week 5 using the concepts introduced in Weeks 1–4, but if you remember your ‘epicycles of analysis’ then you’ll realise that this is, at best, a first pass through the data science process and there are multiple places where insights derived from the practicals (on outliers/problematic records, on data quality issues, on data selection, etc.) could be fed back through the pipeline to adjust and improve the analytical outputs.\nWe will also be shifting our focus in the live session to the final parts of the group submission, but you should also be looking at how this module connects and integrates ideas covered in CASA0001 (UST), CASA0005 (GIS), and CASA0007 (QM). So there will be only a minimal live-coding session in order to leave as much time as possible for the groups to meet and start working on their final projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAn understanding of the differences between aggregation, classification, and clustering.\nAn appreciation of the utility of deriving grouped variables and proxies from raw data.\nAn appreciation of how clustering as part of an analytical pipeline differs from the material covered in CASA0007 and so enhances our understanding of ‘paradigms’ in CASA0001.\nA general appreciation of how different clustering algorithms work and how this differs from classifcation.",

You should be coming out of these readings with a clearer understanding of why there’s rarely a ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ approach to a real-world data set, but there are ‘better’ and ‘worse’ approaches. These readings are predominantly non-academic so they should (I hope) be fairly accessible and quick to read despite the potential dryness of the topics.",

Explain these benefits.\nWhat concerns are raised about the fragmentation of the quantitative methods community identity? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections\n\n\n\nFranklin (2024) offers another perspective on ‘the discipline’ of quantitative human geography and its heterogeneity, while Donoho (2017) will give you context on how data science might differ from what’s covered in Quantitative Methods. You might also find Unwin (1980) useful for understanding why the practicals are set up the way they are and why we don’t post ‘answers’ until a few days after the last practical group has completed its session. You should read Burton (1963) while reflecting on Arribas-Bel and Reades (2018) with a view to seeing that ‘there is nothing new under the sun’: we tend to think that the challenges we face now in terms of data volumes and complexity are novel, but they are not. Indeed, here’s John Graham-Cumming keynoting a 2012 conference talking about the Lyons Tea Company and how its programmers invented Dykstra’s shortest path algorithm more than 20 years before Dykstra did!",

    "text": "How to Help Yourself\nHere are at least six things that you can do to ‘help yourself’:\n\nUse the dedicated #fsds channel on Slack–this provides a much richer experience than the Moodle Forum and should be your primary means of requesting help outside of scheduled teaching hours.\nDo the readings–regardless of whether we ask you questions in class about them (or not), the readings are designed to support the module’s learning outcomes, so if you are struggling with a concept or an idea then please look to the week’s readings! You should also review the full bibliography while developing your thinking for the final project.\nUse Google–this is one course where saying “I googled it…” will be taken as a good sign! Probalby the biggest difference between a good programmer and a new programmer is that the good one knows which terms to type into Google to get the answer that they need right away.\nUse Stack Overflow–as you become a better programmer you’ll start to understand how to frame your question in ways that produce the right answer right away, but whether you’re a beginner or an expert Stack Overflow is your friend.\nMake use of Drop-in Hours (see also below)–there is no extra credit for struggling in silence, and we can’t help you if we don’t know that you’re lost! That doesn’t mean that we can simply ‘give’ you the answers to challenging questions, but we will do everything that we can to support your learning. Many of the same advice applies here as on our other Getting Help page (with the Soft Skills).\nPractice like it’s a language–set yourself little problems or tasks and see if you can apply what you’ve learned in class to a problem in a different class, or a friend’s problem, or just something you’re curious about! In the same way that practicing your Chinese or French with native speakers will help you to learn those languages, so will practicing your Python.\nSign up for online classes–realistically, you will have a lot on your plate, but if you want or need more practice with Python and are strugging to come up with your own problems to work through then there is a wealth of options out there. You might also find that a different explanation or challenge resonates and gives you new insight into how to code.\n\nRemember: when you are learning to code there is no such thing as a stupid question. Sometimes students have lazy questions when they are frustrated and just want to know ‘the answer’, but anyone finding themselves stuck on a particular problem has a 100% chance that someone else in the class has the same problem as well but hasn’t quite worked up the courage to ask. So please: ask."
