[Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law#:~:text=Benford's%20law%2C%20also%20called%20the,life%20sets%20of%20numerical%20data.&text=If%20the%20digits%20were%20distributed,about%2011.1%25%20of%20the%20time), which has [applications in data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-benfords-law-and-why-is-it-important-for-data-science-312cb8b61048) and [fraud detection](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2017/apr/excel-and-benfords-law-to-detect-fraud.html).

::: {.notes}

Genuine randomness is *hard*. Most of us, both humans and computers, tend to use shortcuts when generating random numbers.

People are *really* bad at generating random numbers. Bendford's law is used by auditors to look for abnormalities in financial returns.

Computers are better, but they are also lazy.

## Reproducibility: Good or Bad?

Depends on the problem:

- Banking and encryption?
- Sampling and testing?
- Reproducing research/documentation?

::: {.notes}

OK, technically, even encryption needs to be reproducible to allow for *de*cryption, but you sure don't want it to be *easy*.

:::

## Not Very Good Encryption

| Cyphertext | Output |
| :-------------- | :----- |
| ROT0 | To be or not to be, That is the question | 
| ROT1 | Up cf ps opu up cf, Uibu jt uif rvftujpo | 
| ROT2 | Vq dg qt pqv vq dg, Vjcv ku vjg swguvkqp |
| ... | ... |
| ROT9 | Cx kn xa wxc cx kn, Cqjc rb cqn zdnbcrxw |

ROT is known as the Caesar Cypher, but since the transformation is simple (`A..Z+=x`) decryption is easy now. How can we make this harder?

## Python is Random

```python
import random
random.randint(0,10)
random.randint(0,10)
random.randint(0,10)
random.randint(0,10)
```

See also: `random.randrange`, `random.choice`, `random.sample`, `random.random`, `random.gauss`, etc.

## And Repeat...

```python
import random
size = 10
results = [0] * size

tests = 100000
while tests > 0:
    results[random.randint(0,len(results)-1)] += 1
    tests -= 1

for i in range(0,len(results)):
    print(f"{i} -> {results[i]}")
```

::: {.notes}

What will this return? 

Will it hold for more than 10 numbers?

:::

## Aaaaaaaaaaand Repeat {.smaller}

```python
import random 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

size = 1000
data = [0] * size

tests = 10000000
while tests > 0:
    data[random.randint(0,len(data)-1)] += 1
    tests -= 1

fig = plt.figure()
plt.bar(np.arange(0,len(data)), data)
fig.savefig('Random.png', dpi=150, transparent=True)
```

# Seeding Keys

Computers actually use *pseudo*-random number generators. If they are initialised with a *seed* the will generate the *same* sequence.

::: {.notes}

You might look at that uniform distribution and think 'not bad', but that's not good enough for encryption and it's also not good for reproducibility.

:::

## Setting a Seed

Two main libraries where seeds are set:
```python
import random
random.seed(42)

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)
```

::: {.notes}

Why do you often see 42 used as a seed?

:::

## Seeds and State

```python
import random
random.seed(42)
st = random.getstate()
for r in range(0,3):
    random.setstate(st)
    print(f"Repetition {r}:")
    ints = []
    for i in range(0,10):
        ints.append(random.randint(0,10))
    print(f"\t{ints}")
```


# Question!

Where would you use a mix of randomness and reproducbility as part of a *data* analysis process?



::: {.notes}

Hint: With a large data set it will often be useful to be able draw a random... what? But for reproducible analysis we will that random... what?... to be the same each time!

# Other Applications

## Hashing {.smaller}

Checking for changes (usally in a security context).
```python
import hashlib # Can take a 'salt' (similar to a 'seed')

r1 = hashlib.md5('CASA Intro to Programming'.encode())
print(f"The hashed equivalent of r1 is: {r1.hexdigest()}")

r2 = hashlib.md5('CASA Intro to Programming '.encode())
print(f"The hashed equivalent of r2 is: {r2.hexdigest()}")

r3 = hashlib.md5('CASA Intro to Programming'.encode())
print(f"The hashed equivalent of r3 is: {r3.hexdigest()}")
```

Outputs:
```bash
"The hashed equivalent of r1 is: acd601db5552408851070043947683ef"
"The hashed equivalent of r2 is: 4458e89e9eb806f1ac60acfdf45d85b6"
"The hashed equivalent of r3 is: acd601db5552408851070043947683ef"
```

::: {.notes}

This is like generating a 'fingerprint' of an application or file. In fact, it's what is going on behind the scenes when you download something to install on macOS or Windows and you're told that the installer is being 'verified' before it will run: the computer is generating a hash of the application's codebase, and sending that to the Apple Store or Windows Store or direct to the developer in order to check that the file hasn't been tampered with.

:::

## And Note... {.smaller}

```python
import requests
night = requests.get("http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1514.txt.utf-8")
print(f"The text is {night.text[30:70]}")
print(f"The text is {len(night.text):,} characters long")
hash = hashlib.md5(night.text.encode())
print(f"This can be hashed into: {hash.hexdigest()}")
```

Outputs:
```bash
"The text is A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare"
"The text is 112,127 characters long"
"This can be hashed into: cce0d35b8b2c4dafcbde3deb983fec0a"
```

::: {.notes}

Can be applied to *anything*: even one byte's difference (e.g. in a application) can lead to a different hash output.

But notice that hashes are always the same length. This property is quite useful for databases and verifying the integrity of applications (MD5 Checksums).

:::

## JupyterLab Password {.smaller}

You may have noticed this in Docker:
```bash
'sha1:5b1c205a53e14e:0ce169b9834984347d62b20b9a82f6513355f72d'
```

How this was generated:
```python
import uuid, hashlib
salt = uuid.uuid4().hex[:16] # Truncate salt
password = 'casa2021'        # Set password

# Here we combine the password and salt to 
# 'add complexity' to the hash
hashed_password = hashlib.sha1(password.encode() + 
                  salt.encode()).hexdigest()
print(':'.join(['sha1',salt,hashed_password]))
```

::: {.aside}
Don't set your passwords [this way](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/uk/most-common-passwords-scli-gbr-intl/index.html).
:::

::: {.notes}
Then you can replace the `JUPYTER_PWD` parameter in the start-up string for Docker if you want to set a password.

## Encryption & Security

Simple hashing algorithms are not normally secure enough for full encryption. Genuine security training takes a whole degree + years of experience.

Areas to look at if you get involved in applications:

- Public and Private Key Encryption (esp. OpenSSL)
- Privileges used by Applications (esp. Docker)
- Revocable Tokens (e.g. for APIs)
- Injection Attacks (esp. for SQL using NULL-byte and similar)
