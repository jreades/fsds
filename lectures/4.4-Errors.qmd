# We all make mistakes

It's how we deal with them that matters. Same in Python: understanding and handling errors is the key to good code.


## Helpfully...

Python will always try to tell you what it *thinks* went wrong: "I didn't understand what you meant by this..." or "I'm sorry, I can't let you do that Dave..."

The challenges are:

1. Python tends to give you a *lot* of information about the error: this can be very helpful for programmers dealing with complex problems and *totally overwhelming* for beginners.
2. That what Python thinks the problem is doesn't always line up with where the problem *actually* is. In cases of syntax, for instance, the problem *could* be an unclosed parenthesis *three lines earlier*!


## Challenge 1

That the 'error' isn't always the error...
```python
total = 0
print("About to start loop"
for i in range(1,10):
  total += i
print(total)
```

This outputs:
```python
print("About to start loop"
... for i in range(1,10):
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    for i in range(1,10):
                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

# Dealing with Errors

## Errors Have Types

In the same way that variables have types, so do errors:

- ModuleNotFoundError
- IndexError
- KeyError
- OSError
- ...

We can add our own messages:
```python
raise Exception("Sorry, I can't let you do that, Dave.")
```

::: {.aside}
Lots more built-in error types in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) and imported packages will provide their own as well.
:::

::: {.notes}
Why might different types of errors be *useful*?

We might reasonably want to distinguish between errors that we could reasonably **expect** or that are **not serious**, from those that **we did not expect** or that **call the results of the program into question**.
:::

## Custom Errors

We can create our own types (*classes*) of error:

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
  pass # We do nothing except create a new type
```

This can then be triggered with:
```python
raise CustomError("Our custom error")
```

And (very importantly) this can be caught with:
```python
except CustomError: 
  #... do something with CustomError ...
```

This means that exceptions could accept custom arguments, perform tidying-up or rollback operations, etc.

::: {.notes}
Some of the intricacies of errors can seem quite confusing. What's the point of having a `finally` (which we'll get to in a moment), for instance? Well, if your application is connected to a database then `finally` gives your application a chance to disconnect cleanly (freeing up resources for the database) and even to rollback incomplete changes (e.g. a new user whose details were only partially inputted when the application crashed).
:::

## So Errors can be Trapped

Python calls errors *exceptions*, so this leads to:
```python
try:
  #... some code that might fail...
except <Named_Error_Type>:
  #... what do it if it fails for a specific reason...
except:
  #... what to do if it fails for any other reason...
finally:
  #... always do this, even if it fails...
```
You can use *any* or *all* of these together: you can have multiple named `except`s to handle different types of errors from a single block of code; you do not *have* to have a catch-all `except` or a `finally`.

::: {.notes}

So it makes sense to think: "Well, let's **try** this and see what happens. If we have a problem of *this* type then it's not serious and we should carry on. But if we have a problem *that* type then we need to stop what we're doing right away."

:::

## Trapping Errors

This code fails:
```python
x,y = 10,0
print(x/y)
```

And it generates this error:
```python
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

## Trapping Errors (cont'd)

But if you 'trap' the error using `except` then: 

```python
x,y = 10,0
try:
  print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")
except:
  print("Something has gone very wrong.")
finally: 
  print("Division is fun!")
```
This will print
```
> You can't divide by zero!
> Division is fun!
```

::: {.aside}
*Note:* if we need to access the *actual* exception: `except ZeroDivisionError as e:`
:::

## Raising Hell

You can trigger your *own* exceptions using `raise`.

```python
x,y = 10,0
try:
  print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")
  raise Exception("Please don't do that again!")
finally: 
  print("Division is fun!")
```

## Understanding Multiple Errors {.smaller}

```python
x,y = 10,0
try:
  print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")
  raise Exception("Please don't do that again!")
finally: 
  print("Division is fun!")
```

1. The code we `try` triggers the `ZeroDivisionError` block.
2. This prints `"You can't divide by zero!"` 
3. We then `raise` a new exception that is *not* caught.
4. The `finally` code executes because it *always* does before Python exits.
5. Python exits with the message from our newly **raised** Exception.

Thus: 'During handling of above (ZeroDivisionError) another exception (our Exception) occurred...'


# Understanding exceptions is critical to fixing problems, instead of being overwhelmed by them!


## Test-Based Development

We can actually think of exceptions as a way to *develop* our code. 

Here's some 'pseudo-code':
```python
# Testing the 'addition' operator
test(1+1, 2)           # Should equal 2
test(1+'1', TypeError) # Should equal TypeError
test('1'+'1', '11')    # Should equal '11'
test(-1+1, 0)          # Should equal 0 
```
Our `test(A,B)` function takes an input (A) and the *expected* output (B) and then compares them. The test returns `True` if A==B and `False` otherwise. 


## Unit Tests

Each `test` is a **Unit Test** because it tests *one thing* and *one thing only*. So if you had three functions to 'do stuff' then you'd need at least three unit tests. 

A Unit Test may be composed of one or more **assertions**. Our pseudo-code on the previous slide contained 4 assertions.

A Unit Test does not mean that your code is correct or will perform properly under all circumstances. It means that your code returns the expected value for a specified input.

Python considers this approach so important that it's **built in**.


## Approach 1 {.smaller}

This is an explict assertion to test `fun`:
```python
import unittest

def fun(x):
  return x + 1

class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
  def test(self):
    self.assertEqual(fun(3), 4)
    print("Assertion 1 passed.")
    self.assertEqual(fun(3), 5)
    print("Assertion 2 passed.")

m = MyTest()
m.test()
```
The critical output is:
```python
AssertionError: 4 != 5
```

## Approach 2 {.smaller}

This approach uses the 'docstring' (the bits between `"""`) to test the results of the function. This is intended to encourage good documentation of functions using examples: 
```python
def square(x):
    """Return the square of x.

    >>> square(2)
    4
    >>> square(-2)
    4
    >>> square(-1)
    2
    """
    return x * x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

::: {.aside}
Notice the `__name__` (what could that *possibly* mean???) is tested to see if it's `'__main__'`. The `doctest` code only runs when this code is executed in `'__main__'`.
:::

## Collaboration & Continuous Integration

The Unit Test approach is often used on collaborative projects, especially in the Open Source world. PySAL, [for instance](https://pysal.org/notebooks/viz/splot/intro.html#Contributing-to-splot), asks for unit tests with every new feature or integration.

The running of all tests for multiple components is called 'integration testing'.

A commit, merge, or pull on GitHub can trigger the unit testing process for the *entire* software 'stack'. This is known as *Continuous Integration* because you are *always* checking that the code works as expected, rather than leaving testing to the end.

::: {.notes}

This is heavily used by PySAL and other robust FOSS projects since TravisCI is free for FOSS projects!
