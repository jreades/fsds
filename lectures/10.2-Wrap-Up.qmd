## It's *All* Connected {.center}

> ...Engage [with] GIS as an always-interconnected set of technical and social practices... [we approach] critical GIS as an orientation to GIS praxis that 'does' GIS from within a questioning stance about how we know. [@Elwood:2017]

# So, what is Spatial Data Science?

$$ \sigma = f(\beta, \delta, \kappa, \iota, \pi) $$

## $\beta$ (The Business Problem)

Requirements:

:::{.incremental}
- Understanding of the problem domain (*Why?*).
  - What is the context?
  - What are the priorities?
  - What has (not) been done before?
- Critical thinking wrt to how the problem can be solved (*How?*).
  - Not all problems are data problems.
  - Not all problems are coding problems.
- Ability to communicate with decision-makers/budget-holders (*What?*).
  - Develop a narrative.
  - Focus on the takeaways.
:::

:::{.notes}

- How do you develop a narrative? Through story-telling and analogy/metaphor.
- Refer to experience with telco CRM team.

## Understand the Problem {.center}

> A standard template emerges when reading such work. A cursory review of existing research is reeled off and then set aside. Central questions are reframed in terms of reproducing statistical features of the phenomenon, such as the highly skewed dis- tribution of earthquake magnitudes or city populations. A highly stylized computational, statistical, or mathematical model is demonstrated to exhibit the required statistical features, implying that the model explains the real-world phenomenon. Filling in the details of real-world mechanisms that explain why the model works can be done later by domain-specific experts. The implication is that a general explanatory mechanism is more significant than incidental details of any specific field.

:::{.notes}

- Discussion with telco re: modelling sub-cell level mobility.

## $\delta$ (The Data)

Requirements:

:::{.incremental}
- Understanding of the DGP (*Data Generating Process*).
  - Where does it come from and how is it generated?
  - What is *not* in the data?
  - Is the DGP stable?
- Understanding of the ethics of the data.
  - How *can* it be used?
  - How *should* it be used?
- Ability to map data on to the problem.
  - Cleaning and transforming.
  - Linking and integrating.

## What's a Disaster?

> Social media datasets depict a specific time period, typically defined by the spike in Twitter messages or the use of particular hashtags. This can make it difficult to understand both the causes of disaster and the entire period of aftermath where the impact is realized. This further reifies a problematic short-term conceptions of disaster. In this sense, the analysis of social media during and after a disaster can resemble traditional media coverage, which has been often accused of paying attention to only the most sensational stories in a truncated timeframe... [@Crawford:2015]

## What's a POI?

> Stephens (2013) for example analyses the gendered politics of spatial data crowdsourcing initiatives like Open Street Map, which enable the creation of endless categorizations associated with particular masculinities (brothels, strip clubs) while often wholly omitting feminized places (baby hatches, after-school childcare centres) from these schemas. [@Elwood:2018]

## $\kappa$ (The Code)

Requirements:

:::{.incremental}
- Ability to develop/use appropriate tools.
  - What can I reuse or recycle?
  - Is this solution the right one?
- Ability to visualise an abstract goal.
  - How does this bit of code serve that goal?
  - What is the next step towards that goal?
- Ability to work withing constraints.
  - What is the budget?
  - What is the timeline?
  - What are the limitations?
:::

::: {.notes}

All of these are about *constraints*. The 'correct answer' is defined in part by the constraints you are working within, not the ideal set of knowledge, data, and resources!

:::

## $\iota$ (The Infrastructure)

Requirements:

:::{.incremental}
- Understanding of the pipeline.
  - How is the code deployed?
  - How is the data managed?
  - How is the solution maintained?
- Undertanding of the wider ecosystem.
  - How are issues with the code identified and resolved?
  - How are changes to the data identified and managed?
  - How are reports generated and shared?
  - How are resources allocated?
:::

## The Big Picture {.center}

> ... we need to enroll the practical and technical aspects of GIS use and development directly into modules that address its history of development and implications of use. In doing so, hardware, software, analytic techniques, and data/representation are always presented as both technical and social. From these origins, critical GIS pedagogies aim beyond only building students' conceptual apparatus for critiquing GIS or explaining its social and political implications, toward instilling this technopositionality as their orientation to *doing* GIS.
> [@Elwood:2017]

::: {.notes}

- When we think ecosystem, we should think about *everything*.

:::

## $\pi$ (The Pies)

Requirements:

:::{.incremental}
- 🍕🍕🍕
:::

## So... {.center}

> Let $\sigma$ be the spatial data science solution to a business problem that requires the integration of data, code, infrastructure, and pies...

## But in an urban context... {.center}

Have you heard of IBM's *Smarter Cities* lab?

:::{.notes}

- This is not easy.
- After being a big part of IBM's strategy in the early 2000s, the *Smarter Cities* initiative was quietly dropped in 2016. 
- Importance of the 'assemblage'

## Instrumenting the City {.center}

> The risk here is that the dashboard’s seeming comprehensiveness and seamlessness suggest that we can "govern by Blackberry" — or "fly by instrument" — alone.

# Lastly... {.center}

> Stop. Think.
