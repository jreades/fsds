# Variables

::: {.notes}

At heart, *all* programming is about:

- Storing data (or references to data) in variables,
- Feeding those data into operations,
- Reporting back.

Over time we just get better and better at each of those steps!

Let's start with storing data...
:::


## Variables Have Types...

| Name    | Value                        | Type                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------|
| msg     | 'Hello world'                | `type(msg)==str`          |
| answer  | 42                           | `type(answer)==int`       |
| pi      | 3.14159                      | `type(pi)==float`         |
| c       | complex(5,2)                 | `type(c)==complex`        |
| correct | True                         | `type(correct)==bool`     |


::: {.notes}

As we'll see in Week 4, everything is *also* an object.

:::

## ... But We Can Change That

Message starts as a string:
```python
msg = '42'
type(msg)
```

But we can change it to an integer like this:
```python
msg = int(msg)
type(msg)
```

And back to a string:
```python
msg = str(msg)
type(msg)
```

And notice:
```python
print(str(int('42')))
```

::: {.notes}
That last line of code is intended to start familiarising you with Python syntax: programmers rarely do one operation per line of code if they can do *more* than one so you'll often see nested parentheses like this and you need to learn how to read this kind of code starting from the inner-most parentheses (the `int()`) and working outwards from there to `str()` and finally `print()`.
:::

## ...And They Are _All_ Objects

One to remember for the session on objects and classes:

```python
isinstance(msg,object)     # True
isinstance(answer,object)  # True
isinstance(pi,object)      # True
isinstance(c,object)       # True
isinstance(correct,object) # True
```


## Variables Have Names...

Rules for variable names:

- They cannot start with a number: `item3` is valid, `3items` is not.
- White space and symbols are *not* allowed, but `_` *is* allowed: `my_variable` is valid, `my-variable`, `my$variable`, and `my variable` are not.
- Case matters: `myVar` is different from both `myvar` and `MYVAR`
- Be consistent: `my_var` is more 'Pythonic', though `myVar` is also widely used; but don't mix these!
- Variable names should be *long enough* to be clear but not *so long* as to be impractical: `bldg_height` vs. `bh` vs. `max_building_height_at_eaves`.


## ...But Not All Words Are Allowed

Do not try to use *any* of these as variable names. Python *may* not complain, but strange things will happen when you run your code.

|          |         |        |        |       |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| and      | del     | from   | not    | while |
| as       | elif    | global | or     | with  |
| assert   | else    | if     | pass   | yield |
| break    | except  | import | print  |       |
| class    | exec    | in     | raise  |       |
| continue | finally | is     | return |       |
| def      | for     | lambda | try    |       |

# Operators

## Simple Operations on Variables

Let's start with `x=10` and `y=5`...

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| Sum | `x + y` | `15` |
| Difference | `x - y` | `5` |
| Product | `x * y` | `50` |
| Quotient | `x / y` | `2.0` |
| 'Floored' Quotient | `x // y` | `2` |
| Remainder | `x % y` | `0` |
| Power | `pow(x,y)` or `x**y` | `100000` |
| Equality | `x==y` | `False` |

## Strings Are Different

When you do things with strings the answers can look a little different. Let's start with `x="Hello"` and `y="You"` and `z=2`...

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| Sum | `x + y` | `'HelloYou'` |
| Difference | `x - y` | `TypeError` |
| Product | `x * z` | `HelloHello` | 
| Equality | `x==y` | `False` |


## Using Strings to Output Information

Python has no fewer than three ways output information: 

1. string concatenation using `+`; 
2. string formatting using `<str>.format(<variables>)`; and 
3. f-strings using `f"{variable_1} some text {variable_n}"`. 

There are pros and cons to each:
```python
x = 24
y = 'Something'
print("The value of " + y + " is " + str(x))
print("The value of {0} is {1}".format(y, x))
print(f"The value of {y} is {x}")
```

::: {.notes}

Obviously, a really common requirement that programmers have is 'output a nicely formatted string containing information about the variables in my program'. 

I rather like f-strings because they can actually contain any code you like (you could, for instance, write `f"The square root of {y} is {x**(1/2)}" and it would work. However, concatenation is the easiest to learn.

:::

## Operators Assemble!

Always pay attention to *precedence*:
```python
x, y = 10, 5
x + y * 2         # == 20
(x + y) * 2       # == 30
x + y * 2 / 3     # == 13.3333333333334
x + y * (2/3)     # == 13.3333333333332
(x + y) * (2/3)   # == 10.0
```
And here's a subtle one:
```python
(x * y) ** 2/3    # == 833.333333333334
(x * y) ** (2/3)  # == 13.5720880829745
```
The full list is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence).

::: {.notes}

If you're a little rusty on exponents, that last example is the cube root of `(x*y)**2`. But the key point is that *formatting* is not what matters here, it's operator precedence: one has parentheses, the other does not, so they are evaluated differently. To make the first one more clear we might use `(x * y)**2 / 3` or even `((x*y)**2)/3`.

Also notice that with the two *floats* in the first block you do not always get the same result from operations that *should* give the same answer. Non-terminating decimals (*e.g.* `1/3`) will always be rounded, unpredictably, by the computer because it doesn't have infinite memory. The process of rounding means that you need to be *very* careful comparing floats (more on this later).

:::

## Comparing Variables

For numeric variables comparisons are easy.

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| `==` | `10 == 5` | `False` | 
| `!=` | `10 != 5` | `True` |
| `<`, `<=` | `10 < 5` | `False` |
| `>`, `>=` | `10 > 5` | `True` |

::: {.notes}

The result of any (successful) comparison is a Boolean (True/False). We can save the output of this comparison to a new variable (*e.g.* `z = x > y`).

This last example has to do with the way that strings are compared.

:::

## Strings Are Different

But notice:
```python
w, x, y, z = '4a','4a','365','42'
w == x  # True
w != y  # True
x > y   # True
x > z   # True
```

Why is `4a` greater than *both* `365` and `42`?

## Danger, Will Robinson!

Notice the *very* subtle *visual* difference between `=` and `==`! 

```python
x = 5
y = 10
x = y   # Probably a mistake: setting x to the value of y
x == y  # True, because x and z are now both set to 10
```

**Remember this!**

::: {.notes}
Confusing these two operators is the most common source of mistakes early on when learning to code in Python! One (`=`) does *assignment*, the other (`==`) does *comparison*.
:::


## Common Mistakes

Here's the output from some attempts at comparison:
```python
x, y = '42', 42
x==y   # False
x>y    # An error!
```

This last line produces:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
```

If we want to compare them then we'll need to *change* their type:
```python
x > str(y)   # False
int(x) <= y  # True
x > = str(y) # Also True
```

::: {.notes}

A really common mistake is to think that string (`str`) `"42"` is the same as the integer (`int`) `42`. 

Notice that in the first example we *can* say that 42 is clearly *not* the same as '42', but we can't say whether it's more or less because that's non-sensical in this context. So this is a computer being *totally* logical but not always *sensible*.

Also notice the syntax for this: we have `str(<something>)` and `int(<something>)` to convert between types. These are functions, which we'll spend a lot more time on next week!

Why might it be (fractionally) faster to compare integers than strings?

:::

# Conditions

## Conditions & Consequences

The simplest condition only considers one outcome:
```python
if <condition is true>:
    #...do something...
```
But you'll often needs something a little more sophisticated:
```python
if <condition is true>:
    #...do something...
elif <some other condition is true>:
    #...do something else...
else:
    #...if no conditions are true...

#...code continues...
```
::: {.notes}
But no matter how complex, conditions always ultimately evaluate to `True` or `False`.
:::

## For Example
```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  print("x is not less than y"
```
Or:
```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
  print("x is greater than y")
else:
  print("x equals y")
```


## Conditional Syntax

The most common sources of syntax errors in conditions are:

1. Incorrect **indenting**;
2. Missing **colons** on conditional code;
3. Unbalanced **parentheses**;
4. Incorrect **logic**.


## All of Them Together (Input)!

```python
if hours >= 0:
print("Hours were worked.")
else
	print "No hours were worked.")
```

All **four errors** can be found here, can you spot them?

## All of Them Together (Output)!

Output from the Python interpreter:
```python
>>> if hours >= 0:
... print("Hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print("Hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
>>> else
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    else
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>     print "No hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "No hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```


## That's Better!

It's _relatively_ straightforward to figure out the **syntax errors**, but the **logical error** is much less obvious. Over time, you become far _more_ likely to make logical errors than syntactical ones. 
```python
if hours > 0:
    print("Hours were worked.")
else:
    print("No hours were worked.")
```


# Comment Your Code

::: {.notes}

One way to reduce the risk of logic errors is to comment your code!

:::

## Make Your Life Easy (Well, Easier)


Always comment your code:

1. So that you know *what* is going on.
2. So that you know *why* it is going on.
3. So that others can *read your code*.
4. To help you *plan* your code



::: {.notes}

You are reminding your future self what your code was *for* and helping to give it structure (explaining==thinking!).

:::

## Different Comment Styles


```python
# This is a short comment
print("Foo")
print("Bar") # Also a short comment

# ------- New Section --------
# You can have comments span multiple
# lines just by adding more '#' at the 
# start of the line.

# You can keep code from running
# print("Baz")
```


## Comments Follow Indentation

```python
# Function for processing occupational data
# from the 2001 and 2011 Censuses.
def occ_data(df):
  #  Columns of interest
  cols = ['Managerial','Professional','Technical']
    
  # Integrate results into single dataset -- 
  # right now we don't replicate Jordan's approach of
  # grouping them into 'knowledge worker' and 'other'. 
  for i in df.iterrows():
    # For each column...
    for j in cols:
      # Do something
      ...
```


## Easier Multi-Line Comments

The below are not _real_ comments, but they can help when you have a really long comment that you want to make. They are also used to help explain what a function does (called a `docstring`).

```python
"""
So I was thinking that what we need here is 
a way to handle the case where the data is
incomplete or contains an observation that we
weren't expecting (e.g. "N/A" instead of "0").
"""
```


## Tips


Some useful tips for commenting your code:

- Include general information at the top of your programming file.
- Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves.
- Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is used judiciously, and concise without being gnomic.
- Use comments to track the logic of your code (especially in conditionals and loops)
