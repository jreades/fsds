## Dummy Variables

The concept of 'dummy variables' in economics/regression is a useful point to start thinking about text:

| Topic         | Dummy | 
| ------------- | ----- | 
| News          | 0     | 
| Culture       | 1     | 
| Politics      | 2     | 
| Entertainment | 3     | 

::: {.notes}
What's the problem with this approach when you're thinking about the topics in a document? You either have to assign each document to one, and only one, topic, or you need a _lot_ of dummies.

## One-Hot Encoders

| Document           | UK   | Top  | Pop  | Coronavirus |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| News item          | 1    | 1    | 0    | 1           |
| Culture item       | 0    | 1    | 1    | 0           |
| Politics item      | 1    | 0    | 0    | 1           |
| Entertainment item | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1           |

::: {.notes}

One-Hot encoders are not _often_ used this way, but for keyword detection or keyword-based classification this might be appropriate: i.e. this keyword was used in this document! 

So the big difference is One Hot == $n$ variables, Dummy == $n-1$.

Definitely some 'gotchas' in deployment: one-hot models shouldn't have an intercept unless you apply a 'ridge shrinkage penalty'. Standardisation affects whether or not an intercept is needed.

## The 'Bag of Words'

Just like a one-hot (binarised approach) on preceding slide but now we count occurences:

| Document           | UK   | Top  | Pop  | Coronavirus |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| News item          | 4    | 2    | 0    | 6           |
| Culture item       | 0    | 4    | 7    | 0           |
| Politics item      | 3    | 0    | 0    | 3           |
| Entertainment item | 3    | 4    | 8    | 1           |


## BoW in Practice

Enter, stage left, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/):

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Non-reusable transformer
vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Reusable transformer
vectorizer.fit(texts)
vectors1 = vectorizer.transform(texts1)
vectors2 = vectorizer.transform(texts2)

print(f'Vocabulary: {vectorizer.vocabulary_}')
print(f'All vectors: {vectors.toarray()}')
```


## TF/IDF

Builds on Count Vectorisation by normalising the document frequency measure by the overall corpus frequency. Common words receive a large penalty:

$$
W(t,d) = TF(t,d) / log(N/DF_{t})
$$

For example: 

- If the term 'cat' appears 3 times in a document of 100 words then Term Frequency given by: $TF(t,d)=3/100$, and
- If there are 10,000 documents and cat appears in 1,000 documents then Normalised Document Frequency given by: $N/DF_{t}=10000/1000$ so the Inverse Document Frequency is $log(10)=1$,
- So IDF=1 and TF/IDF=0.03.


## TF/IDF in Practice


```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Non-reusable form:
vectors=vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Reusable form:
vectorizer.fit(texts)
vectors = vectorizer.transform(texts)

print(f'Vocabulary: {vectorizer.vocabulary_}')
print(f'Full vector: {vectors.toarray()}')
```

::: {.notes}

What do you notice about how this code differs from the CountVectorizer?

## Term Co-Occurence Matrix (TCM) {.smaller}

Three input texts with a distance weighting ($d/2$, where $d<3$):

- the cat sat on the mat
- the cat sat on the fluffy mat
- the fluffy ginger cat sat on the mat

|        | fluffy |  mat | ginger |  sat |   on |  cat |  the |
| :----- | -----: | ---: | -----: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| fluffy |        |    1 |      1 |      |  0.5 |  0.5 |  2.0 |
| mat    |        |      |        |      |  0.5 |      |  1.5 |
| ginger |        |      |        |  0.5 |  0.5 |  1.0 |  1.5 |
| sat    |        |      |        |      |  3.0 |  3.0 |  2.5 |
| on     |        |      |        |      |      |  1.5 |  3.0 |
| cat    |        |      |        |      |      |      |  2.0 |
| the    |        |      |        |      |      |      |      |


## How Big is a TCM?

The problem:

- A corpus with 10,000 words has a TCM of size $10,000^{2}$ (100,000,000)
- A corpus with 50,000 words has a TCM of size $50,000^{2}$ (2,500,000,000)

Cleaning is _necessary_, but it's not _sufficient_ to create a tractable TCM on a large corpus.

::: {.notes}
Although usually used in the context of clustering, there's also a curse of dimensionality here!
:::

## Enter Document Embeddings

Typically, some kind of 2 or 3-layer neural network that 'learns' how to _embed_ the TCM into a lower-dimension representation: from $m \times m$ to $m \times n, n << m$. 

Similar to PCA in terms of what we're trying to achieve, but the *process* is utterly different.

::: {.notes}
Many different approaches, but [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (Stanford), [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) (Google), [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html) (Facebook), and [ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo) (Allen) or [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) (Google) are probably the best-known.

## Sentiment Analysis 

Requires us to deal in great detail with bi- and tri-grams because *negation* and *sarcasm* are hard. Also tends to require training/labelled data.
