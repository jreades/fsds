## Start with a Chart

The problem of relying on statistics alone was amply illustrated by Anscombe’s Quartet (1973)...

- We *are not* very good at looking at spreadsheets. 
- We *are* very good at spotting patterns visually.

Sometimes, we are *too* good; that’s where the stats comes in. Think of it as the ‘tiger in the jungle’ problem..

## But What do They _Look_ Like?

![](img/Quartet.png)


# The Tiger that Isn't

> I would argue that the basic purpose of charts and of statistics as a whole is to help us untangle signal from noise. We are ‘programmed’ to see signals, so we need to set the standard for ‘it’s a tiger!’ quite high in research & in policy-making.



::: {.notes}

Or, as Albert Einstein reportedly said: "If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."

:::

## Think it Through

You can make a lot of progress in your research without *any* advanced statistics!

- A 'picture' isn’t *just* worth 1,000 words, it could be a whole dissertation!
- The right chart makes your case eloquently and succinctly. 

Always ask yourself:

- What am I trying to say?
- How can I say it most effectively?
- Is there anything I’m overlooking in the data?

A good chart is a good way to start!


## What Makes a Good Plot?

A good chart or table:

1. Serves a **purpose** — it is clear how it advances the argument in a way that could not be done in the text _alone_.
2. Contains only what is **relevant** — zeroes in on what the reader _needs_ and is not needlessly cluttered.
3. Uses precision that is **meaningful** — doesn't clutter the chart with needless numbers.

::: {.notes}

Far too many charts or tables could be easily written up in a single sentence.

Far too many charts or tables contain redundancy, clutter, and 'flair'.

Don't report average height of your class to sub-millimeter level accuracy, or lat/long to sub-atomic scale.

## For Example... {.smaller}

How much precision is necessary in measuring [degrees at the equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees#Precision)?

| Decimal Places | Degrees    | Distance |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------: |
| 0              | 1          |    111km |
| 1              | 0.1        |   11.1km |
| 2              | 0.01       |   1.11km |
| 3              | 0.001      |     111m |
| 4              | 0.0001     |    11.1m |
| 5              | 0.00001    |    1.11m |
| 6              | 0.000001   |   11.1cm |
| 7              | 0.0000001  |   1.11cm |
| 8              | 0.00000001 |   1.11mm |

## The Purpose of a Chart

The purpose of a graph is to show that there are *relationships* within the data set that are _not_ trivial/expected.

Choose the chart to highlight relationships, or the lack thereof:

- Think of a chart or table as part of your ‘argument’ – if you can’t tell me how a figure advances your argument (or if your explanation is more concise than the figure) then you probably don’t need it.
- Identify & prioritise the relationships in the data.
- Choose a chart type/chart symbology that gives emphasis to the most important relationships.

# If a picture is worth 1,000 words, make sure those words aren't "blah, blah, blah..."


# Not Everyone Likes Tables

> Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber.
> Arthur & Henry Fahrquhar (1891)


## Real Numbers

Consider the difference in emphasis between:

- 11316149
- 11,316,149
- 11.3 million
- 11 x 10$^{6}$
- 22%
- 22.2559%

Always keep in mind the *purpose* of the number.


## There's _Still_ a Role for Tables

Why a table is sometimes better than a chart:

- You need to present data values with greater detail
- You need to enable readers to draw comparisons between data values
- You need to present the same data in multiple ways (*e.g.* raw number *and* percentage)
- You want to show many dimensions for a small number of observations

::: {.notes}

*e.g.* percentage of people falling into each ethnic or income category for a small number of wards or boroughs.

## Design for Tables

Principles:

- Reduce the number of lines to a minimum (and you should almost never need vertical lines).
- Use ‘white-space’ to create visual space between groups of unrelated (or less related) elements.
- Remove redundancy (if you find yourself typing ‘millions’ or ‘GBP’ or ‘Male’ repeatedly then you’ve got redundancy).
- Ensure that meta-data is clearly separate from, but attached to, the graph (*i.e.* source, title, etc.).
