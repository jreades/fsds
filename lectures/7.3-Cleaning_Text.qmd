# Bye, bye, for loop!

::: {.notes}

Another great example of something where what makes sense to a human is not always the fastest way to *get things done*.

Code is *embarassingly parallel* if the problem so clearly lacks interconnections with other problems that the code can be *run* in parallel without any effort.

*Vectorisation* is the process (usually done 'under the hood' *for* you rather than explicitly *by* you) by which code that, by default, runs linearly is modified to run in parallel.

:::

## When a Loop Is Not Best

If you need to apply the same operation to lots of data why do it *sequentially*?

- Your computer has many cores and can run many threads *in parallel*.
- The computer divides the work across the threads it sees fit.
- The computer reassemble the answer at the end from the threads.

If you have 4 cores then parallelisation cuts analysis time by 75%. 

## So Do More with Each Clock Cycle

- Many libraries/packages implement weak forms of vectorisation or parallelisation, but some libraries do more.
- You must request it because it requires hardware or other support and it is highly optimsed.
- Multiple separate machines acting as one.
- Multiple GPUs acting as one.

::: {.notes}
Conceptually, these get challenging if you can't clearly separate/parallelise tasks.

## Pandas.apply() vs. Numpy

Numpy is fully vectorised and will almost *always* out-perform Pandas `apply`, but both are massive improvements on for loops:

- Execute row-wise and column-wise operations.
- Apply any arbitrary function to individual elements or whole axes (i.e. row or col).
- Can make use of `lambda` functions too for 'one off' operations (ad-ohoc functions).

## Lambda Functions {.smaller}

Functional equivalent of list comprehensions: 1-line, anonymous functions.

For example:

```python
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5)) # 15
```

Or:

```python
full_name = lambda first, last: f'Full name: {first.title()} {last.title()}'
print(full_name('guido', 'van rossum')) # 'Guido Van Rossum'
```

These are very useful with pandas.


## Let's Compare {.smaller}

```python
import time
import numpy as np
def func(a,b):
  c = 0
  for i in range(len(a)): c += a[i]*b[i]
  return c

a = np.random.rand(1000000)
b = np.random.rand(1000000)
t1 = time.time()
print(func(a,b))
t2 = time.time()
print(np.dot(a,b))
t3 = time.time()

print(f"For loop took {(t2-t1)*1000:.0f} milliseconds")
print(f"Numpy took {(t3-t2)*1000:.0f} milliseconds")
```
Generally, I get `numpy` taking 86ms, while the `for` loop takes 331ms!

# Dealing with Structured Text

## Beautiful Soup & Selenium

Two stages to acquiring web-based documents:

1. Accessing the document: `urllib` can deal with many issues (even authentication), but *not* with dynamic web pages (which are increasingly common); for that, you need [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) (library + driver).
2. Processing the document: simple data can be extracted from web pages with RegularExpressions, but *not* with complex (esp. dynamic) content; for that, you need [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

These interact with wider issues of Fair Use (e.g. rate limits and licenses); processing pipelines (e.g. saving WARCs or just the text file, multiple stages, etc.); and other practical constraints.


## Regular Expressions / Breaks

Need to look at how the data is organised:

- For very large corpora, you might want one document at a time (batch).
- For very large files, you might want one line at a time (streaming).
- For large files in large corpora, you might want more than one 'machine'.

# Managing Vocabularies

::: {.notes}

A lot of what you'll see here are, at best, heuristics with enormous variation in practice.

:::

## Starting Points

These strategies can be used singly or all-together:

- Stopwords
- Case
- Accent-stripping
- Punctuation
- Numbers

But these are just a *starting* point!

::: {.notes}

What's the semantic difference between 1,000,000 and 999,999?

:::

## Distributional Pruning


We can prune from both ends of the distribution:

- Overly *rare* words: what does a word used in *one* document help us to understand about a corpus?
- Overly *common* ones: what does a word used in *every* document help us to understand about a corpus?

::: {.notes}

Again, no hard-and-fast rules: can be done on raw counts, percentage of all documents, etc. Choices will, realistically, depend on the nature of the data.

# Stemming & Lemmatisation

## Different Approaches

Humans use a *lot* of words/concepts^[A recent digitsation effort by Harvard and Google estimated 1,022,000 unique word-forms in English *alone* ([Source](https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/language-lab/many-words-english-language/)).]:

- Stemming: rules-based truncation to a stem (can be augmented by language awareness).
- Lemmatisation: usually dictionary-based 'deduplication' to a lemma (can be augmented by POS-tagging).

## Different Outcomes

| Source     | Porter  | Snowball | Lemmatisation |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| monkeys    | monkey  | monkey   | monkey        |
| cities     | citi    | citi     | city          |
| complexity | complex | complex  | complexity    |
| Reades     | read    | read     | Reades        |

```python
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
for w in ['monkeys','cities','complexity','Reades']:
    print(f"Porter: {PorterStemmer().stem(w)}")
    print(f"Snowball: {SnowballStemmer('english').stem(w)}")
    print(f"Lemmatisation: {wnl.lemmatize(w)}")
```
