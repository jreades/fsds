## Literate Programming

Ideally, we want to 'do' data science in ways that are '[literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)'.

> The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct. ~ @knuth:1996

## Key Tenets

What we want:

1. **Weaving**: the code and its documentation are together.
2. **Tangling**: the code can be run directly.

In an ideal world, these are the *same* file...

---

<div style="margin-top: 250px;">
<h1>But **why** would we want this?</h1>
</div>

## And **how** do we do this?

*Hint*: it's more than just one thing...

::: {.incremental}
1. **JupyterLab**: how we do 'data science'.
2. **Virtualisation**: separate your computer from your coding environment.
3. **Version Control**: manage your code, your data, and even your reports.
4. **Markup**: focus on the *structure* while you write!
5. **Render**: creating documents and web pages from code and markup.
::: 

# Jupyter(Lab) & Notebooks

> Browser + JupyterLab + Markup == Tangled, Woven code in (m)any languages

::: {.notes}

*Note*: you can set equations too!

:::

## Why Use JupyterLab?

Coding in JupyterLab has a number of advantages over 'point-and-click':

::: {.incremental}
1. Coding requires our instructions to be unambiguous and logical.^[This does not guarantee that they'll be *correct*.]
2. Computers are infinitely patient so we can re-run as many times as necessary to get it 'right'.
3. There is nothing to install (runs in your web browser).
4. You can run code from anywhere (runs in your web browser).
:::

## The Bigger Picture

> If we can't explain it simply enough that a computer can do it, perhaps we don't actually understand it?

::: {.incremental}
- Together with the other tools in this talk, you can largely stop worrying about *where* code is running.
- It's easy to forget how you obtained a particular result when you are clicking around inside software like ArcGIS; this is *much* harder when using code.
- In analysing the problem so that we can submit it to the computer we often develop a better understanding of the problem ourselves!
- Why spend your time doing the boring stuff???
::: 

::: {.notes}
Conversely, perhaps the *real* value of humans over AI lies in what *cannot* be explained to the computer.

# Virtualisation

> ... a technology that enables the creation of virtual environments from a single physical machine, allowing for more efficient use of resources by distributing them across computing environments.
> 
> Source: @susnjara:2025

## Two Basic 'Flavours'

Both do the *same* thing: separate the platform from the hardware, but they do this in defferent ways for different reasons.

- A 'full' Virtual Machine (VM) includes the Operating System and behaves like a *separate computer* even though it may share hardware with other VMs.
- A 'container' is a 'lightweight' VM running only the application and its dependencies; everything else is managed by the host Operating System so the resulting 'image' is small and easy to distribute.

Short version: if you have to install an Operating System you are using a full VM; otherwise you are probably using a containerisation tool/

Many things, including storage, networks, CPUs, GPUs, etc. can be virtualised.

## Why Use Containers?

We gain quite a few benefits:

1. Easier installation and 'everyone' has the same versions of the code.
2. Each container is isolated and read-only.
3. Easy to tidy up when you’re done.
4. Easy to scale up and scale down, or to link them together via 'microservices'.
5. Used in the ‘real world’ by *many* companies (JP Morgan Chase, GSK, PayPal, Twitter, Spotify, Uber...).

## The Bigger Picture

> Rather than having one environment for *every* project, we have one environment for *each* project.

- 'Computing contexts' are disposable, while data and code are persistent when I need them.
- I don't care where my code and data are, so long as they're accessible when I need them.
- I don't care if containers are created or destroyed, so long as they're available when I need them. 
- I rebuild or update the computing context when I am ready to do so.

## Podman

![](./img/Podman-logo.png){style="width:85%;"}

> Podman is an **open source** container and image management engine. Podman makes it easy to find, run, build, and share containers.

## Using Podman

Podman makes configuring a development environment (fairly) simple. If a Podman image works for us then we *know*[^1] it works for you. 

Use either: 

1. `{{< var docker.all >}}` (Windows and Older Macs)
2. `{{< var docker.mac >}}` (Newer Macs)

[^1]: Usually, but not always, true.

# Version Control

> ... is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
>
> Source: [Altassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

## Why use Version Control?

> ... If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
>
> Source: [Altassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

In addition:

::: {.incremental}
- We can **share** code with others (directly) as source code or (indirectly) as the product of compiling that source code.
- We can **rewind**, **fast forward**, and **combine** changes by different people working on different features.
- We gain detailed, incremental **backups** that help us tro track down the changes that introduced a bug when something goes wrong.
:::

::: {.notes}

Discuss comparison with Dropbox or OneDrive. How are they similar, how are they different? File level vs. row-level views. 
:::

## The Bigger Picture

> In open source projects there may be no *one* view of what the 'right' solution/version of a project is, so differences need to be *negotiated*.

- Every computer with version control might have the 'right' version of the code for a given user, so there is no 'master' view of a project.
- We need to be able to choose whether to *merge* other people's changes with our changes, rather than having everything forced on us.
- We still want to be able to share *our* version of the code / outputs of the code with other people, and a web site is a good way to do that.

## Git

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](./img/Git.png)
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
Version control allows us to:

1. Track changes to files with a high level of detail using `commit`.
2. `push` these changes out to others.
3. `pull` down changes made by others.
4. `merge` and resolve conflicting changes.
5. Create a `tag` when a 'milestones' is reached.
6. Create a `branch` to add a feature.
7. Retrieve specific versions or branches with a `checkout`.

## GitHub

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](./img/Octocat.png)
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
Git is distributed, meaning that every computer is a potential server *and* a potential authority. **Result**: commits on a plane!

But how do people find and access your code if your 'server' is a home machine that goes to sleep at night? **Result**: GitHub.

GitHub is 'just' a very large Git server with a *lot* of nice web-friendly features tacked on: create a web site, issue/bug tracking, promote your project...

# Markup

> A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document...
>
> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)

## Why use Markup?

::: {.incremental}
- Quickly sketch out the structure of a document.
- Focus on the substance, not the style.
- Works well with version control (line-by-line changes + GitHub.io web site).
- Combine code, documentation, and narrative easily.

&nbsp;

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz
$$

### Custom Markup

<pre>
&lt;div style="border: dotted 2px red; margin-top: 25px; background-color: rgb(230,230,230)"&gt;
  This content has HTML formatting attached.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

&nbsp;

<div style="border: dotted 2px red; margin-top: 25px; background-color: rgb(230,230,230)">
  This content has HTML formatting attached.
</div>

# Render

> 'Rendering' is the process of taking all of the code and markup and outputting it to a particular format (web page, web site, PDF, etc.). So it's the last piece of this pipeline for working with data, code, and text.

## Why Render?

::: {.incremental}
- Outputs can be: web pages, Jupyter notebooks, Word documents, PDFs, presentations... 
- It can be really useful to have a single input and *multiple* outputs because requirements and needs *always* change.
- It teaches you to focus on the process, not the minutiae.
:::

## The Bigger Picture

> **Everything** this week was created using these basic tools and techniques. It has transformed the way I teach, do research, and write! It **embodies** the potential of 'literate programming' [@knuth:1984].

# Recap

- Podman is how you will run a virtual machine with all the necessary tools pre-installed.
- JupyterLab is how you will 'talk' to the virtual machine and tell it to run code.
- Markdown is how you will write simply-formatted content (in JupyterLab and Quarto)
- Git/GitHub is how you ~will~ *can* manage code and content so that you always have a backup plan.
- Rendering in Quarto is how you will output nicely formatted code and content.
