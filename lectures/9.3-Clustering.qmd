## Spot the Difference

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Classification

- Allocates *n* samples to *k* groups
- Works for different values of *k* 
- Different algorithms (*A*) present different views of group relationships
- Poor choices of *A* and *k* lead to weak understanding of data
- Typically works best in 1–2 dimensions

### Clustering

- Allocates *n* samples to *k* groups
- Works for different values of *k*
- Different algorithms *A* present different views of group relationships
- Poor choices of *A* and *k* lead to weak understanding of data
- Typically works best in < 9 dimensions

::: {.notes}

Clustering algorithms can suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' such that high-dimensional spaces cluster poorly without *either* dimensionality reduction *or* the use of specialist algorithms such as [Spherical *k*-Means](https://coclust.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.1/api/clustering.html#module-coclust.clustering.spherical_kmeans).

## The First Geodemographic Classification?

## Intimately Linked to Rise of The State

- Geodemographics only possible in context of a State -- without a Census it simply wouldn't work... until now?
- Clearly tied to social and economic 'control' and intervention: regeneration, poverty & exclusion, crime, etc.
- Presumes that *areas* are the relevant unit of analysis; in geodemographics these are usually called *neighbourhoods*... which should ring a few bells.
- In practice, we are in the realm of 'homophily', a.k.a. Tobler's *First Law of Geography*


## Where is it used?

Anything involving grouping individuals, households, or areas into larger 'groups'…

- Strategic marketing (above the line, targeted, etc.)
- Retail analysis (store location, demand modelling, etc.)
- Public sector planning (resource allocation, service development, etc.)

Could see it as a subset of *customer segmentation*.


# Computational Context

## Problem Domains

|                  | Continuous               | Categorical    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Supervised**   | Regression               | Classification |
| **Unsupervised** | Dimensionality Reduction | Clustering     |


::: {.notes}

- In classification we 'know' the answer (we test against labels).
- In clustering we don't 'know' the answer (we look for clusters).

:::

# > What is a cluster?

::: {.notes}

A group of *similar* data points.

:::

# > What is the purpose of clustering?


::: {.notes}

To *generalise* from 'raw' data.

## Measuring 'Fit'

> Usually working towards an 'objective criterion' for quality... these are known as cohesion and separation measures.


## How Your Data Looks...

Clustering is one area where standardisation (and, frequently, normalisation) are *essential*:

- You don't (normally) want scale in any one dimension to matter more than scale in another.
- You don't want differences between values in one dimension to matter more than differences in another.
- You don't want skew in one dimension to matter more than skew in another.

You also want *uncorrelated* variables... why?


## First Steps

You will normally want a *continuous* variable... so these types of data are especially problematic: 

- Dummies / One-Hot Encoded
- Categorical / Ordinal
- Possible solutions: *k*-modes, CCA, etc.

## Performance

Typically about trade-offs between:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="25%"}
- Accuracy
- Generalisation
:::
::: {.column width="75%"}

## Trade-Offs

Need to balance:

- Ability to cluster at *speed*.
- Ability to *replicate* results.
- Ability to cope with *fuzzy/indeterminate* boundaries.
- Ability to cope with *curse of dimensionality*.
- Underlying *representation* of group membership...


## Visualising the Trade-Offs

::: {.notes}

Notice the limitations to *k*-means: it may be fast but it's got problems if your data is non-linear/non-Gaussian.

And this doesn't even include options like HDBSCAN, HAC/Hierarchical Clustering, and many more!
