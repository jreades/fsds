## Approaching EDA

There's _no_ hard and fast way of doing EDA, but as a general rule you're looking to:

- Clean
- Canonicalise
- Clean More
- Visualise & Describe
- Review
- Clean Some More
- ... 

The 'joke' is that 80% of Data Science is data cleaning.

::: {.notes}

Cleaning Part 1: testing validity of records (possibly while tracking rejected records for subsequent analysis)

Canonicalisation: controling for variation (e.g. typos, capitalisation, formatting, leading/trailing whitespace, different types of NULL values, etc.) and in a spatial context deal with projection and geo-data issues.

Cleaning Part 2: further testing of records (e.g. deciding what to do with NaNs, missing values, outside of study area, etc.)

Visualise & Describe: covered in QM but we'll take a high-level look at this.

## A Related Take

[EDA—Don't ask how, ask what](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/exploratory-data-analysis-eda-dont-ask-how-ask-what-2e29703fb24a):

- **Descriptive Statistics**: get a high-level understanding of your dataset.
- **Missing values**: come to terms with how bad your dataset is.
- **Distributions and Outliers**: and why countries that insist on using different units make our jobs so much harder.
- **Correlations**: and why sometimes even the most obvious patterns still require some investigating.


## _Another_ Take

Here's another view of how to do EDA:

1. **Preview** data randomly and substantially
2. **Check totals** such as number of entries and column types
3. **Check nulls** such as at row and column levels
4. **Check duplicates**: do IDs recurr, did the servers fail
5. **Plot distribution** of numeric data (univariate and pairwise joint distribution)
6. **Plot count** distribution of categorical data
7. **Analyse time series** of numeric data by daily, monthly and yearly frequencies

## Start with a Chart

The problem of relying on statistics alone was amply illustrated by Anscombe’s Quartet (1973)...

- We *are not* very good at looking at spreadsheets. 
- We *are* very good at spotting patterns visually.

Sometimes, we are *too* good; that’s where the stats comes in. Think of it as the ‘tiger in the jungle’ problem..

## But What do They _Look_ Like?

![](img/Quartet.png)


## The Tiger that Isn't

> I would argue that the basic purpose of charts and of statistics as a whole is to help us untangle signal from noise. We are ‘programmed’ to see signals, so we need to set the standard for ‘it’s a tiger!’ quite high in research & in policy-making.



::: {.notes}

Or, as Albert Einstein reportedly said: "If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."

:::

## Think it Through

You can make a lot of progress in your research without *any* advanced statistics!

- A 'picture' isn’t *just* worth 1,000 words, it could be a whole dissertation!
- The right chart makes your case eloquently and succinctly. 

Always ask yourself:

- What am I trying to say?
- How can I say it most effectively?
- Is there anything I’m overlooking in the data?

A good chart is a good way to start!


## What Makes a Good Plot?

A good chart or table:

1. Serves a **purpose** — it is clear how it advances the argument in a way that could not be done in the text _alone_.
2. Contains only what is **relevant** — zeroes in on what the reader _needs_ and is not needlessly cluttered.
3. Uses precision that is **meaningful** — doesn't clutter the chart with needless numbers.

::: {.notes}

Far too many charts or tables could be easily written up in a single sentence.

Far too many charts or tables contain redundancy, clutter, and 'flair'.

Don't report average height of your class to sub-millimeter level accuracy, or lat/long to sub-atomic scale.

:::

## For Example... {.smaller}

How much precision is necessary in measuring [degrees at the equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees#Precision)?

| Decimal Places | Degrees    | Distance |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------: |
| 0              | 1          |    111km |
| 1              | 0.1        |   11.1km |
| 2              | 0.01       |   1.11km |
| 3              | 0.001      |     111m |
| 4              | 0.0001     |    11.1m |
| 5              | 0.00001    |    1.11m |
| 6              | 0.000001   |   11.1cm |
| 7              | 0.0000001  |   1.11cm |

## The Purpose of a Chart

The purpose of a graph is to show that there are *relationships* within the data set that are _not_ trivial/expected.

Choose the chart to highlight relationships, or the lack thereof:

- Think of a chart or table as part of your ‘argument’ – if you can’t tell me how a figure advances your argument (or if your explanation is more concise than the figure) then you probably don’t need it.
- Identify & prioritise the relationships in the data.
- Choose a chart type/chart symbology that gives emphasis to the most important relationships.

# If a picture is worth 1,000 words, make sure those words aren't "blah, blah, blah..."


# Beyond the Chart

## Not Everyone Likes Tables

> Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a cucumber.
> Arthur & Henry Fahrquhar 1891)


## Real Numbers

Consider the difference in emphasis between:

- 11316149
- 11,316,149
- 11.3 million
- 11 x 10$^{6}$
- 22%
- 22.2559%

Always keep in mind the *purpose* of the number.


## There's _Still_ a Role for Tables

Why a table is sometimes better than a chart:

- You need to present data values with greater detail
- You need to enable readers to draw comparisons between data values
- You need to present the same data in multiple ways (*e.g.* raw number *and* percentage)
- You want to show many dimensions for a small number of observations

::: {.notes}

*e.g.* percentage of people falling into each ethnic or income category for a small number of wards or boroughs.

## Postgraduate Tables (Failing Grade)

![](img/pgtables-2.png)


## Design for Tables

Principles:

- Reduce the number of lines to a minimum (and you should almost never need vertical lines).
- Use ‘white-space’ to create visual space between groups of unrelated (or less related) elements.
- Remove redundancy (if you find yourself typing ‘millions’ or ‘GBP’ or ‘Male’ repeatedly then you’ve got redundancy).
- Ensure that meta-data is clearly separate from, but attached to, the graph (*i.e.* source, title, etc.).


# In Practice

## Getting Started {.smaller}

You can follow along by loading the Inside Airbnb sample:

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
url='https://bit.ly/3I0XDrq'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.set_index('id', inplace=True)
df['price'] = df.price.str.replace('$','',regex=False).astype('float')
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, 
            geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(
                        df['longitude'], 
                        df['latitude'], 
                        crs='epsg:4326'
            )
      )
gdf.to_file('Airbnb_Sample.gpkg', driver='GPKG')
```

::: {.notes}
Note that this  (re)loads the sampled Airbnb data from GitHub every time you run it. For a large data set on someone else'e server you might want to save and (re)load it locally. A simple helper function would then just check if the file already existed locally *before* trying to download the file again: that would allow you to work while offline and speed up your code substantially too!

::: {.notes}

Notice how we have the *same* functionality, but it operates at the level of the data set itself now. We gain a few *new* functions as well that relate to interactions between columns (a.k.a. data series).

:::

## Measures

So pandas provides functions for commonly-used measures:

```python
print(f"{df.price.mean():.2f}")
print(f"{df.price.median():.2f}")
print(f"{df.price.quantile(0.25):.2f}")
```

Output:
```
118.4542
80.50
40.75
```

## More Complex Measures {.smaller}

But Pandas *also* makes it easy to derive new variables... Here's the *z*-score:

$$ z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$$

```python
df['zscore'] = (df.price - df.price.mean())/df.price.std()
df.plot.box(column='zscore')
```

![](./img/Price_BoxPlot.png)

## And Even More Complex {.smaller}

And here's the Interquartile Range Standardised score:

$$ x_{iqrs} = \frac{x - \widetilde{x}}{Q_{75} - Q_{25}} $$

```python
df['iqr_std'] = (df.price - df.price.median())/ \
      (df.price.quantile(q=0.75)-df.price.quantile(q=0.25))
df.plot.box(column='iqr_std')
```

![](./img/Price_IQR_Standardised.png)


## The Plot Thickens

We'll get to more complex plotting over the course of the term, but here's a good start for *exploring* the data! All plotting depends on `matplotlib` which is the ogre in the attic to R's `ggplot`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Get used to this import as it will allow you to save and manipulate the figures created in Python. It is *not* the most intuitive approach (unless you've used MATLAB before) but it *does* work. 

# **Confession Time:** I *do* like `ggplot` and sometimes even finish off graphics for articles in R *just* so that I can use `ggplot`; however, it *is* possible to generate great-looking figures in `matplotlib` but it is often more work because it's a _lot_ less intuitive.


## Boxplot

```python
df.price.plot.box()
plt.savefig('pboxplot.png', dpi=150, transparent=True)
```

![](img/pboxplot.png)


## Frequency

```python
df.room_type.value_counts().plot.bar()
plt.savefig('phistplot.png', dpi=150, transparent=True)
```

![](img/phistplot.png)


## A Correlation Heatmap

We'll get to these in more detail in a couple of weeks, but here's some output... 

![](img/correlation.png)


## A 'Map'

```python
df.plot.scatter(x='longitude',y='latitude')
plt.savefig('pscatterplot.png', dpi=150, transparent=True)
```

![](img/pscatterplot.png)


## A Fancy 'Map'

```python
df.plot.scatter(x='longitude',y='latitude',
                c='price',colormap='viridis',
                figsize=(10,5),title='London',
                grid=True,s=24,marker='x')
plt.savefig('pscatterplot.png', dpi=150, transparent=True)
```

![](img/pscatterplot-fancy.png)


## An Actual 'Map'

```python
gdf.plot(column='price', cmap='viridis', 
         scheme='quantiles', markersize=8, legend=True)
```
