## Do You Want?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Consider the following three things I've said to my toddler:

1. Do you want to go to the park **and** have ice cream?
2. Do you want cereal **or** toast for breakfast?
3. Do **not** touch that again or else!

Unlike my toddler, the computer *does* listen, but my toddler has more common sense!

## In Code Now {.smaller}

```python
(x,y) = True,False
if x:
  print("x")

if x and y:
  print("x and y")

if x or y:
  print("x or y")

if x and not y:
  print("x and not y")

if not(x and y):
  print("not x and y")
```

::: {.notes}

`if x` is the simplest: if `True` then print `"x"`. There is no logic, we just do it or we don't depending on whether x is True.

`if x and y` is the 'park and ice cream question': there's no ice cream without going to the park. So both things have to be True for this to work out happily and `print("x and y")`.

`if x or y` is the 'cereal or toast for breakfast' question: my daughter is having breakfast either way, so if she answers 'Yes' (True) to either then it doesn't matter that the other one is False, she's still had breakfast, or we're still printing "x or y". And note, if she was really hungry and said yes to both then _that_ would _also_ be breakfast. So if they are both True that's also fine.

`if x and not y`: is the negation of one term. So 'if you behave and *don't* touch that again then you will get a treat' is what we're looking for here. But you can *also* negate the entire thing: `not(x and y)` is also valid logic. So this turns a False on `if x and y` into a True.

## Combining Logic With Operators {.smaller}

Remember that operators like `<=` and `==` also produce True/False answers:
```python
x = y = 5
z = 3
if x==y:
  print("x==y")

if x==y and x==z:
  print("x==y and x==z")

if x==y or x==z:
  print("x==y or x==z")

if x==y and not x==z:
  print("x==y and not x==z")
```


## A Special Case

There is a *second* set of logical operators that apply in very specific circumstances. These are called 'bitwise' operators and apply to data specified in *bits*.

| Regular Operator | Bitwise Equivalent |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
| `and` | `&` |
| `or`  | `|` |
| `not` | `~` |

Let's see (briefly) how these work...


## Working With Bits

```python
x,y = 38,3
print(f"{x:b}") # `:b` means byte-format
print(f"{y:b}")
```
This gives us that `x` is `'100110'` and `y` is `'11'`, so now:
```python
print(f"{x & y:b}")  # 10
print(f"{x | y:b}")  # 100111
print(f"{x & ~y:b}") # 100100
```


## Perhaps Easier to See This Way?

| Operator | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **x** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| **y** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **x & y** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **x \| y** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **~y** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| **x & ~y** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Bitwise operations are *very*, *very* fast and so are a good way to, say, find things in large data sets. **You've been warned.**

::: {.notes}

They are how pandas and numpy manage indexes and queries against data frames.

## Nulls: None vs. NaN

Beware of using logic with things that are _not_ what they appear: 

- `None` is Python's way of saying that something has **no value at all** (not `0` or `""`... but _None_). It is a **class**.
- NaN (Not a Number) is a special numeric data type provided by the `numpy` package to deal with things like -ve and +ve infinity and similar 'issues'. 

`np.nan` should be used whenever you are dealing with _data_ (_e.g._ see Pandas!). 


## None vs. NaN

```python
import numpy as np
print(type(np.nan))     # float
print(type(None))       # NoneType
```

Critically:
```python
print(""==None)         # False
print(None==None)       # True
print(np.nan==None)     # False
print(np.nan==np.nan)   # False!
print(np.nan is np.nan) # True
print(np.isnan(np.nan)) # True
```

# Membership

## In / Not In

We've touched on these before:
```python
g = ['Harvey','Rose','Batty','Jefferson']

if 'Batty' in g:
  print("In the group!")

if 'Marx' not in g:
  print("Not in the group!")
```

The `set` data type also supports `in`, and `not in` together with all of the set maths (`union`, `intersect`, etc.).

::: {.notes}
This is a good place for a recap though.
:::

## Sets

Membership maths:

```python
s1 = {'cherry','orange','banana','tomato'} # Or s1(...)
s2 = {'potato','celery','carrot','tomato'} # Or s2(...)
print('potato' in s1)      # False
print(s1.difference(s2))   # {'banana', ...}
print(s1.intersection(s2)) # {'tomato'}
print(s1.union(s2))        # {'orange', ...}
```

These more advanced functions are only for sets, not lists or dicts.
