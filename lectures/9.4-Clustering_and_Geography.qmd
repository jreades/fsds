## Space Adds Complexity

We now have to consider *two more* types of clustering:

1. With respect to polygons: regions are built from adjacent zones that are more similar to one another than to other adjacent zones.
2. With respect to points: points are distributed in a way that indicates 'clumping' at particular scales.

::: {.notes}

Type 1 is probably what you were thinking of in terms of clustering.

Type 2 is point pattern analysis and should be considered a substantially different area of research and type of analysis.

:::

## Trade-offs (Again)...

Consider:

- Clustering algorithms are *inherently* spatial.
- Clustering algorithms do not take ~~space~~ *geography* into account.

Does this *matter*?

::: {.notes}

All clustering algorithms are about inter-observation and intra-cluster distances so they have *some* conceptualisation of 'space'.

Spatially-aware clustering algorithms exist but are generally much more computationally-intensive than 'regular ones'.

## Different Approaches {.smaller}

| Algorithm | Pros | Cons  | Geographically Aware? |
|:----|:----------------|:----------------|:-------| 
| [k-Means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) | Fast. Deterministic. | Every observation to a cluster. | N. |
| [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html) | Allows for clusters *and* outliers. | Slower. Choice of $\epsilon$ critical. Can end up with all outliers. | N, but implicit in $\epsilon$. |
| [OPTICS](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.OPTICS.html) | Fewer parameters than DBSCAN. | Even slower. | N, but implicit in $\epsilon$. |
| [Hierarchical](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.htmlg)/ [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Can cut at any number of clusters. | No 'ideal' solution. | Y, with connectivity parameter. |
| [ADBSCAN](https://pysal.org/esda/generated/esda.adbscan.ADBSCAN.html) | Scales. Confidence levels. | May need large data set to be useful. Choice of $\epsilon$ critical. | Y. |
| [Max-p](https://splot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/tutorials/region.html#max-p) | Coherent regions returned. | Very slow if model poorly specified. | Y. |


## Setting the Relevant Distance

Many clustering algorithms rely on a distance specification (usually $\epsilon$). So to set this threshold:

- In high-dimensional spaces this threshold will need to be large.
- In high-dimensional spaces the scale will be meaningless (i.e. not have a real-world meaning, only an abstract one).
- In 2- or 3-dimensional (geographical) space this threshold *could* be meaningful (i.e. a value in metres *could* work).


## Choosing a Distance Metric

| *n* Dimensions | How to Set | Examples |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------|
| 2 or 3 | Theory/Empirical Data | Walking speed; Commute distance |
| 2 or 3 | [K/L Measures](https://pysal.org/notebooks/explore/pointpats/distance_statistics.html#Interevent-Distance-Functions) | Plot with Simulation for CIs to identify significant 'knees'. |
| 3 | [Marked Point Pattern?](https://pysal.org/notebooks/explore/pointpats/marks.html#Marked-Point-Pattern) |
| > 3 | [kNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-clustering-dbscan-determine-the-optimal-value-for-epsilon-eps-python-example-3100091cfbc) | Calculate average kNN distance based on some expectation of connectivity. |

::: {.notes}

Remember: inter-observation distance increases with dimensionality!
